# PRD: Onboarding Backend Database Integration

## Executive Summary

This PRD focuses on creating the critical missing link between the existing frontend onboarding wizard and backend services to enable seamless, fast, and easy user onboarding completion. The primary goal is to integrate the frontend with backend services and AI, establish proper database structures, and ensure personal and organizational data persistence.

**Value Proposition:** Transform the current onboarding experience into a fully integrated system where users can complete onboarding faster and easier, with all their personal and organizational data automatically saved and persisted in the database for immediate use in the OKR management platform.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- ✅ Frontend 4-step onboarding wizard is complete and functional
- ✅ AI-powered suggestions and validation endpoints are operational
- ✅ Basic onboarding API endpoints exist for session management
- ✅ NeonDB PostgreSQL database with enhanced schema is configured

### The Problem
**Missing Frontend-Backend Integration:** While the frontend onboarding wizard exists and AI services are available, there is no complete integration that allows users to easily complete onboarding with automatic data persistence.

**Specific Issues:**
1. **Frontend-Backend Disconnect:** Onboarding wizard may not be fully connected to backend services for seamless data submission
2. **Database Structure Gaps:** Missing or incomplete database schema to properly store personal and organizational onboarding data
3. **Data Persistence Failures:** User onboarding data is not being saved reliably to enable immediate use post-completion
4. **AI Integration Incomplete:** AI assistance may not be fully integrated to make onboarding faster and easier
5. **User Experience Friction:** Users cannot complete onboarding smoothly due to technical integration gaps

### Why Now?
- Frontend onboarding wizard exists but needs backend integration to be functional
- Users expect a smooth, fast onboarding experience with immediate data persistence
- AI services are available but need integration to enhance user experience
- Business requires operational onboarding to convert users into active platform users

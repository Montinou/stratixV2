# PRD: Switch to NeonDB

## Executive Summary

Complete migration of StratixV2 from Supabase to NeonDB with total Supabase dependency removal. Use NeonAuth for authentication (following https://neon.com/docs/neon-auth/quick-start/nextjs) and implement @scripts/ for schema migrations with automatic CI/CD pipeline integration. This migration is schema-only (no existing data migration) and includes updating all database connections throughout the codebase and removing all Supabase packages and configurations.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Current database performance may not scale with growing user base and data volume
- **Cost Optimization**: Need for more predictable and potentially lower database costs as the application scales
- **PostgreSQL Compatibility**: Desire for standard PostgreSQL features that may be limited in Supabase's managed environment
- **Vendor Diversification**: Reducing dependency on a single vendor for critical infrastructure components

### Why Now?
- Application has recently achieved stability after fixing infinite loop and authentication issues
- Current database schema is well-defined and stable
- Growing user base requires more scalable database infrastructure
- Cost projections indicate potential savings with NeonDB's serverless model

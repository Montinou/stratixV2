# PRD: Complete Authentication Integration

## Executive Summary

Build a comprehensive authentication integration layer that seamlessly bridges Stack Auth with NeonDB, providing secure session management, automatic profile synchronization, and role-based access control. This system will replace temporary stub implementations with a production-ready authentication foundation that supports the entire OKR management application.

## Problem Statement

### Current Authentication Gap
The application currently has a fragmented authentication system:
- **Stack Auth**: Handles user authentication and basic identity management
- **NeonDB**: Contains detailed user profiles, company associations, and role information
- **Stub Bridge**: Temporary implementations providing fallback functionality
- **No Real Integration**: No automatic synchronization between Stack users and database profiles

### Core Problems
1. **Profile Data Disconnect**: Stack users exist independently of database profiles
2. **Manual Profile Creation**: No automatic profile creation for new Stack users
3. **Session Management Gap**: No persistent session state with profile data
4. **Role Access Issues**: Role-based permissions not properly integrated
5. **Company Assignment Problems**: No systematic way to assign users to companies
6. **Data Synchronization**: Stack user updates don't reflect in database profiles

### Business Impact
- New users experience broken onboarding with missing profile data
- Role-based features don't work correctly due to missing database integration
- User management is manual and error-prone
- Authentication state is inconsistent across application components
- Customer support burden from authentication-related issues

### Why This is Critical Now
- NeonDB infrastructure is complete and production-ready
- API endpoints are implemented and tested
- Stub implementations are preventing real user flows
- Application is ready for production deployment
- User base growth requires scalable authentication

## User Stories

# PRD: Memory System

## Executive Summary

The Memory System is an intelligent knowledge management feature for StratixV2 that captures, organizes, and surfaces organizational learning from OKR cycles. It transforms fragmented strategic insights into a searchable, actionable knowledge base that improves decision-making, prevents repeated mistakes, and accelerates team learning.

**Value Proposition**: Enable organizations to build upon their strategic successes and learn from failures by creating an institutional memory that grows smarter with each OKR cycle.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

Organizations using OKR management face critical knowledge retention challenges:

1. **Strategic Amnesia**: Valuable insights from completed OKR cycles are lost or forgotten
2. **Repeated Failures**: Teams make the same strategic mistakes across different periods
3. **Knowledge Silos**: Successful patterns and learnings are trapped within individual teams
4. **Context Loss**: New team members lack access to historical decision-making context
5. **Inefficient Planning**: Strategic planning starts from scratch each cycle without leveraging past learnings

### Why is this important now?

- **Competitive Advantage**: Organizations that learn faster outperform those that don't
- **Remote Work Era**: Distributed teams need explicit knowledge sharing mechanisms
- **Rapid Change**: Accelerating business environments require faster learning cycles
- **Scale Challenges**: Growing organizations struggle to maintain institutional knowledge
- **AI Opportunity**: Modern technology enables intelligent pattern recognition and insights

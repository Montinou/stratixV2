# Project Brief

## What It Does

**StratixV2** is a modern OKR (Objectives and Key Results) management application that helps teams set, track, and achieve strategic goals through a data-driven, collaborative platform.

### Core Purpose
Transform how organizations manage strategic objectives by providing:
- **Clear Goal Setting**: Structured approach to defining measurable objectives

# Project Brief

## What It Does

**StratixV2** is an advanced OKR (Objectives and Key Results) management platform with integrated memory system capabilities, built to transform how organizations set, track, and achieve strategic goals through intelligent, data-driven collaboration.

### Core Purpose
Revolutionize organizational strategic management by providing:
- **Intelligent Goal Architecture**: Memory-enhanced objective setting with context preservation
- **Real-time Performance Intelligence**: Live tracking with predictive analytics
- **Organizational Alignment**: Cross-functional coordination with shared context

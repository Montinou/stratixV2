# Project Brief

## Project Identity

**Project Name**: StratixV2
**Project Type**: OKR Management System / Internal Tools Platform
**Development Phase**: Post-Migration Stabilization
**Primary Language**: Spanish (ES) with English (EN) internationalization support

## What It Does

StratixV2 is a comprehensive OKR (Objectives and Key Results) management platform that enables organizations to:

- **Align Strategic Goals**: Create hierarchical objectives from corporate level down to individual activities
- **Track Progress**: Monitor real-time progress with visual dashboards and analytics
- **Manage Teams**: Role-based access control with Corporate, Manager, and Employee permissions
- **Generate Insights**: AI-powered daily insights and recommendations based on performance data
- **Secure Access**: Email-based access control with domain whitelisting and individual approvals

## Why It Exists

### Business Problem
Organizations struggle with strategic alignment and goal tracking, leading to:
- Disconnected objectives across departments
- Lack of visibility into progress and performance
- Time-consuming manual reporting processes
- Difficulty in identifying performance bottlenecks
- Poor communication between management levels

### Solution Approach
StratixV2 addresses these challenges by providing:
- **Structured Framework**: Three-tier OKR hierarchy (Objectives â†’ Initiatives â†’ Activities)
- **Real-time Visibility**: Live dashboards with progress indicators and analytics
- **Intelligent Insights**: AI-driven recommendations and performance analysis
- **Secure Collaboration**: Role-based access with comprehensive user management
- **Modern Technology**: Built on scalable, serverless infrastructure

## Project Scope

### Core Features (In Scope)
1. **OKR Management System**
   - Hierarchical goal structure
   - Progress tracking and reporting
   - Deadline and timeline management
   - Performance analytics

2. **User Management**
   - Stack Auth authentication integration
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Email-based access control
   - Admin panel for user management

3. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Real-time dashboards
   - Progress visualization
   - Historical trend analysis
   - Export capabilities

4. **AI Integration**
   - Daily insights generation
   - Performance recommendations
   - Role-specific suggestions

### Out of Scope
- Third-party integrations (Phase 2)
- Mobile native applications (web-responsive instead)
- Advanced workflow automation
- Multi-tenant architecture (single organization focus)

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **User Experience**: Intuitive, accessible interface for all user roles
2. **Performance**: Fast, responsive application with <2s page load times
3. **Security**: Enterprise-grade security with PostgreSQL RLS and JWT authentication
4. **Scalability**: Support for up to 1000 concurrent users
5. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with robust error handling

### Success Criteria
- **User Adoption**: 90% of target users actively using the system within 30 days
- **Performance**: Sub-2-second page load times across all major features
- **Data Integrity**: Zero data loss incidents with comprehensive backup strategy
- **User Satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score (NPS) above 70
- **System Availability**: 99.9% uptime with minimal service disruptions

## Key Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: Must use Next.js 15, TypeScript, NeonDB, Stack Auth
- **Hosting**: Deployment on Vercel platform
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with NeonDB serverless architecture
- **Authentication**: Stack Auth integration (no custom auth solutions)

### Business Constraints
- **Timeline**: Stabilization phase following major migration
- **Budget**: Operating within free tiers of Neon, Stack, and Vercel
- **Team**: Single developer with specialized agents for complex tasks
- **Scope**: Internal tools focus, not public-facing application

### Design Constraints
- **UI Framework**: Must use shadcn/ui component library
- **Design System**: Consistent with modern internal tools aesthetics
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance for inclusive access
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-friendly responsive design

## Current Status

### Recently Completed
- âœ… **Migration from Supabase to NeonDB**: Complete infrastructure change
- âœ… **Stack Auth Integration**: Modern authentication system implementation
- âœ… **OKR Hierarchy System**: Complete three-tier goal structure
- âœ… **Code Cleanup**: Removal of legacy components and streamlined architecture

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ **System Stabilization**: Testing and validation post-migration
- ðŸ”„ **Context Documentation**: Comprehensive project documentation
- ðŸ”„ **Build Verification**: Ensuring all components work with new infrastructure

### Next Phase
- **Testing & Validation**: Comprehensive system testing
- **Documentation Updates**: Align all documentation with new architecture
- **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune for production deployment
- **User Acceptance**: Validate core workflows with stakeholders

## Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Development Team**: Technical implementation and maintenance
- **End Users**: Corporate executives, managers, and employees using the system
- **System Administrators**: Managing user access and system configuration

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **IT Security**: Ensuring compliance with security requirements
- **Business Operations**: Integration with existing business processes
- **Support Team**: Providing user assistance and troubleshooting

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Migration Stability**: New infrastructure may have unexpected issues
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing and gradual rollout
- **Performance**: Complex queries may impact system responsiveness
  - *Mitigation*: Query optimization and caching strategies

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Resistance to new system after migration
  - *Mitigation*: Training programs and gradual feature introduction
- **Data Security**: Handling sensitive organizational data
  - *Mitigation*: Enterprise security practices and regular audits

StratixV2 represents a modern, scalable approach to OKR management, built on proven technologies and designed for sustainable growth and user satisfaction.

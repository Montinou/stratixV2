# Project Brief

## Project Name

**StratixV2** - Strategic Planning and OKR Management Platform

## Project Purpose

Build a modern, multi-tenant SaaS application that enables organizations to manage their strategic planning through OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), track execution through initiatives and activities, and measure progress with real-time analytics.

## Business Objectives

1. **Provide Strategic Clarity**: Help organizations align their teams around common objectives
2. **Enable Progress Tracking**: Give visibility into goal achievement across all levels
3. **Support Multi-Tenant Operations**: Serve multiple companies with isolated data and custom branding
4. **Streamline Collaboration**: Facilitate team coordination and communication around strategic goals
5. **Deliver Actionable Insights**: Provide analytics that inform strategic decisions

## Technical Objectives

1. **Modern Architecture**: Leverage Next.js 15 App Router and React Server Components
2. **Database-First Security**: Implement Row Level Security at PostgreSQL level
3. **Serverless Deployment**: Deploy to Vercel Edge for global performance
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with Drizzle ORM
5. **Scalable Infrastructure**: NeonDB serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling

## Scope

### In Scope
- OKR hierarchy management (objectives, key results, initiatives, activities)
- Multi-tenant company management with data isolation
- User authentication and authorization via Stack Auth
- Email invitation system with Brevo integration
- Company-specific theming and branding
- Data import/export functionality (CSV/XLSX)
- Real-time dashboards and analytics
- Role-based access control
- Administrative tools and settings

### Out of Scope (Current Phase)
- Mobile native applications
- Third-party integrations (Slack, Teams, etc.)
- Advanced AI/ML features
- Custom workflow automation
- API for external systems
- White-label reseller program

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must use Next.js 15 with App Router architecture
- PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security required
- Vercel deployment platform (Edge runtime)
- TypeScript strict mode enforced
- No client-side database queries (security requirement)

### Business Constraints
- Multi-tenant architecture (shared infrastructure, isolated data)
- Company data must never leak between tenants
- Email delivery dependent on Brevo service availability
- Free tier limitations on NeonDB connections

### Resource Constraints
- Single development team
- No dedicated DevOps/infrastructure team
- Limited budget for third-party services
- Development timeline constraints

## Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Product Owner**: Defines features and priorities
- **Development Team**: Implements and maintains the platform
- **End Users**: Companies using the platform for strategic planning

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **System Administrators**: Manage company settings and invitations
- **Support Team**: Assist users with onboarding and issues
- **Infrastructure Providers**: Vercel, NeonDB, Brevo, Stack Auth

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] Application builds and deploys successfully
- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode with zero errors
- [ ] Row Level Security properly enforced
- [ ] API response times < 200ms (p95)
- [ ] Database connection pooling working
- [ ] Email delivery rate > 95%

### Business Success
- [ ] User onboarding flow completion > 80%
- [ ] Active weekly users per company > 70%
- [ ] Objective creation rate steady growth
- [ ] Zero data leakage incidents
- [ ] Customer satisfaction score > 4.0/5.0

### User Success
- [ ] Time to first objective < 5 minutes
- [ ] Invitation acceptance rate > 60%
- [ ] Feature adoption across modules > 50%
- [ ] User retention rate > 85% monthly

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Database connection limits | High | Medium | Connection pooling + NeonDB autoscaling |
| Email delivery failures | Medium | Low | Database-first design (email non-blocking) |
| Multi-tenant data leakage | Critical | Low | RLS + extensive testing + security audits |
| Third-party service outages | Medium | Medium | Graceful degradation + status monitoring |

### Business Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Low user adoption | High | Medium | User onboarding optimization + training |
| Competition from established tools | Medium | High | Focus on unique features (RLS, custom branding) |
| Scalability issues | High | Low | Serverless architecture + monitoring |

## Dependencies

### External Services
- **NeonDB**: PostgreSQL database hosting
- **Vercel**: Application hosting and edge deployment
- **Stack Auth**: Authentication and user management
- **Brevo**: Transactional email delivery

### Internal Dependencies
- Database schema migrations
- Email template design and testing
- User acceptance testing
- Documentation and training materials

## Budget Considerations

### Infrastructure Costs
- NeonDB: Serverless PostgreSQL (pay-per-use)
- Vercel: Hosting and edge deployment (pro plan)
- Brevo: Email sending (tiered pricing)
- Stack Auth: Authentication (per-user pricing)

### Development Costs
- Development time and effort
- Testing and quality assurance
- Documentation and training
- Security audits

## Quality Standards

- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint rules, Prettier formatting
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E tests for critical workflows
- **Security**: Regular security audits, RLS verification, penetration testing
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals targets, API response time monitoring
- **Documentation**: Up-to-date technical and user documentation

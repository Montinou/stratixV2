# Project Brief

## What It Does

**StratixV2** is a comprehensive OKR (Objectives and Key Results) management system that helps organizations align, track, and achieve their strategic goals through a hierarchical objective structure with AI-powered insights.

### Core Capabilities

1. **Hierarchical Goal Management**
   - Define strategic Objectives
   - Break down into tactical Initiatives
   - Track operational Activities
   - Cascade goals throughout organization

2. **Multi-Tenant Platform**
   - Isolated company workspaces
   - Role-based access (Corporate, Manager, Employee)
   - Secure data separation
   - White-label potential

3. **Analytics & Insights**
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Visual performance dashboards
   - AI-generated insights
   - Trend analysis

4. **Collaboration Features**
   - Team area management
   - Cross-functional initiatives
   - Progress updates
   - Status tracking

5. **Data Management**
   - CSV/XLSX bulk import
   - Data validation
   - Export capabilities
   - Historical tracking

## Why It Exists

### Problem Statement
Organizations struggle with:
- **Strategy Execution Gap**: 67% of well-formulated strategies fail due to poor execution
- **Alignment Issues**: Teams don't understand how their work connects to company goals
- **Visibility Problems**: Leadership lacks real-time insight into progress
- **Manual Tracking**: Spreadsheets are error-prone, outdated, and don't scale
- **Language Barriers**: Most OKR tools are English-first, underserving Spanish markets

### Solution Approach
StratixV2 solves these problems by:
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Three-level structure (Objectives → Initiatives → Activities)
- **Real-Time Visibility**: Live dashboards with up-to-date progress
- **AI Assistance**: Intelligent insights and recommendations
- **Role-Based Views**: Each user sees relevant information for their level
- **Data Import**: Easy migration from existing spreadsheets
- **Spanish-First**: Native Spanish interface for LATAM/Spain markets

## Success Criteria

- **Hosting**: Vercel serverless (execution time limits)
- **Budget**: Free/low-cost tiers during development

### Business Constraints
- **Timeline**: MVP needed for pilot customers
- **Resources**: Small development team
- **Market**: Focus on Spanish-speaking markets initially
- **Competition**: Need differentiation from established players

### Dependencies

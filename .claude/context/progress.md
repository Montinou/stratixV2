# Project Progress

## Current Status

**Branch:** main
**Last Commit:** 4d4f56c - docs: add comprehensive epic summary report for Real Data Infrastructure
**Repository:** https://github.com/Montinou/stratixV2.git
**Current Phase:** Post-Epic Stabilization - Security Hardening Required

## Recent Major Work

### Real Data Infrastructure Epic #96 (Just Completed ✅)
**Epic Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - 100% (10/10 tasks)
**Migration Coverage:** 83% (5/6 pages)
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-01

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ #97: Database Schema & Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ #98: Analytics Service Layer Implementation
- ✅ #99: Objectives Service Layer Implementation
- ✅ #100: Initiatives Service Layer Implementation
- ✅ #101: Activities Service Layer Implementation
- ✅ #102: Page Component Migration (5/6 pages)
- ✅ #103: RLS Policy Testing Suite
- ✅ #104: Multi-Tenant Security Audit
- ✅ #105: Performance Benchmarking Infrastructure
- ✅ #106: Implementation Documentation Updates

**Key Deliverables:**
- Service layer pattern with `withRLSContext()` wrapper for tenant isolation
- Type-safe database queries using Drizzle ORM
- PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) policies on all tenant-scoped tables
- Comprehensive security audit suite (`scripts/verify-rls-policies.ts`)
- Performance benchmarking infrastructure for ongoing monitoring
- Complete migration guide and troubleshooting documentation

**Critical Findings:**
- 🔴 **SECURITY BLOCKER**: RLS bypass vulnerability detected (neondb_owner role has BYPASSRLS privilege)
  - Detailed in: `docs/security-audit-report.md`
  - Must fix before production deployment
- 🟡 **PERFORMANCE**: RLS context overhead 188ms vs <50ms target
  - Detailed in: `docs/performance-benchmark-results.md`
  - Optimization plan documented

**Documentation Created:**
- `docs/EPIC_REAL_DATA_INFRASTRUCTURE_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive epic summary
- `docs/security-audit-report.md` - Security audit findings and mitigation plan
- `docs/performance-benchmark-results.md` - Performance testing results
- `MOCK_DATA_REPLACEMENT_GUIDE.md` - Implementation guide with troubleshooting

### Multi-Tenant System (Completed ✅)
- ✅ **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Complete RLS policies implementation for tenant isolation
- ✅ **Tenant Management**: Organization-based multi-tenancy with proper data isolation
- ✅ **Database Migrations**: New migrations for tenant_id columns and RLS policies

### User Onboarding System (Completed ✅)
- ✅ **Onboarding Flow**: Complete user onboarding with organization creation
- ✅ **Team Invitations**: Complete invitation workflow for team members
- ✅ **Admin Approval Workflow**: Organization approval process

### Authentication System (Completed ✅)
- ✅ **Stack Auth Integration**: Production-ready authentication system
- ✅ **Neon Auth Integration**: Database-backed user profiles
- ✅ **Multi-Provider Support**: Google, GitHub, and email authentication

### Current Working State

**Production-Ready Features:**
- ✅ Multi-tenant architecture with PostgreSQL RLS
- ✅ Real data infrastructure (5/6 pages migrated: 83%)
- ✅ Service layer pattern with type-safe database queries
- ✅ User onboarding with organization creation
- ✅ Team invitation system
- ✅ Stack Auth + Neon Auth integration
- ✅ Comprehensive security testing suite
- ✅ Performance benchmarking infrastructure

**Migrated Pages (Real Data):**
- ✅ OKR Dashboard (`/tools/okr`) - Analytics service
- ✅ Objectives (`/tools/objectives`) - Full CRUD with stats
- ✅ Initiatives (`/tools/initiatives`) - Budget tracking included
- ✅ Activities (`/tools/activities`) - Activity feed operational
- ✅ Updates (`/tools/updates`) - Timeline and history
- ⏸️ Insights (`/tools/insights`) - Deferred (complex analytics)

**Service Layer Architecture:**
- `lib/services/analytics-service.ts` (612 lines) - Dashboard & analytics
- `lib/services/objectives-service.ts` (134 lines) - Objectives management
- `lib/services/initiatives-service.ts` (139 lines) - Initiatives management
- `lib/services/activities-service.ts` (137 lines) - Activities management
- `lib/database/rls-client.ts` - RLS context wrapper

## Outstanding Changes (Git Status)

**Clean working tree** - All changes committed and pushed to origin/main

## Immediate Next Steps

### Critical Priority (Before Production)
1. **🔴 Fix RLS Bypass Vulnerability**
   - Create restricted database role without BYPASSRLS privilege
   - Update connection strings to use new role
   - Test tenant isolation with restricted role
   - Follow migration plan in `docs/security-audit-report.md`

2. **🟡 Optimize RLS Context Performance**
   - Implement connection pooling with pre-warmed connections
   - Cache tenant_id lookups to reduce set_config calls
   - Target: <50ms overhead (currently 188ms)

### High Priority
3. **Complete Insights Page Migration**
   - Implement advanced analytics queries
   - Design complex data aggregation service
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days

4. **Production Deployment Preparation**
   - Run final security audit with fixed RLS
   - Performance optimization and testing
   - Load testing for production traffic
   - Documentation review and updates

### Medium Priority
5. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Set up error tracking (Sentry or similar)
   - Implement query performance monitoring
   - Add tenant isolation monitoring alerts

## Development Focus Areas

**Critical Blockers:**
- 🔴 RLS bypass vulnerability (security-audit-report.md:45-89)
- 🟡 Performance optimization needed (target <50ms RLS context)

**Next Epic Candidates:**
1. Security Hardening Epic (recommended next)
2. Performance Optimization Epic
3. Insights Page Advanced Analytics Epic
4. Admin Panel Enhancement Epic

## Architecture Status

The project has **successfully completed the Real Data Infrastructure epic** with:
- ✅ Complete service layer implementation (4 services, 24 functions)
- ✅ PostgreSQL RLS policies on 7 tenant-scoped tables
- ✅ Type-safe Drizzle ORM integration
- ✅ Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- ✅ 83% migration coverage (5/6 pages)
- ⚠️ Critical security fix required before production
- ⚠️ Performance optimization recommended

**Current Phase:** Post-Epic Stabilization
**Production Readiness:** 🟡 Ready After Security Fix
**Recommended Next:** Security Hardening Epic to address RLS bypass vulnerability

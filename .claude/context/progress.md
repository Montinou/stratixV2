# Project Progress

## Current Status

**Branch:** main
**Last Commit:** cb846e9 - ðŸ§¹ Remove custom session management and use ONLY native Neon Auth
**Repository:** https://github.com/Montinou/stratixV2.git

## Recent Major Work

### Authentication System Migration (Recently Completed)
- âœ… **Complete migration from Supabase to NeonDB + NeonAuth**: Major infrastructure change completed
- âœ… **Removed custom session management**: Simplified to use native Neon Auth patterns only
- âœ… **OKR Hierarchy System**: Complete implementation of objectives and key results hierarchy
- âœ… **Onboarding Backend Database Integration**: Full database integration for user onboarding process
- âœ… **Stack Auth Integration**: Official Neon Stack Auth native pattern implementation

### Current Working State

**Clean Codebase:** Extensive cleanup has been performed with many legacy files removed:
- Removed legacy Supabase integration files
- Cleaned up AI gateway infrastructure files
- Removed old migration scripts and database setup files
- Streamlined component structure

**Active Code Structure:**
- Core Next.js application with TypeScript
- Authentication via Stack Auth (@stackframe/stack)
- Database via Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- UI components via shadcn/ui and Radix UI
- Basic internal tools template structure

## Outstanding Changes (Git Status)

### Modified Files
- `README.md` - Updated project documentation
- `app/globals.css` - Styling updates
- `app/layout.tsx` - Layout component updates
- `app/page.tsx` - Homepage updates
- Multiple UI components updated to latest shadcn patterns
- Database configuration files updated

### New Untracked Files
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific Claude instructions
- `.env.development.local` - Local environment configuration
- New component structure in `components/okr/`, `components/admin/`
- Stack Auth configuration files
- Database schema files in `drizzle/`

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Environment Stabilization**: Commit current changes and establish clean working state
2. **Testing & Validation**: Ensure all core functionality works after major cleanup
3. **Documentation**: Update project documentation to reflect new architecture
4. **Build Verification**: Confirm application builds and deploys successfully

## Development Focus Areas

**High Priority:**
- Core authentication flow validation
- Database connection and schema verification
- Basic admin panel functionality
- User access control system

**Medium Priority:**
- OKR system functionality
- Internal tools development
- Component library completion

## Architecture Status

The project is currently in a **post-migration stabilization phase** following a major infrastructure change from Supabase to NeonDB. The codebase has been significantly cleaned up but needs verification and testing to ensure all systems work correctly with the new authentication and database infrastructure.

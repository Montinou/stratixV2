# Project Overview

## System Summary

StratixV2 is a modern, secure OKR (Objectives and Key Results) management platform designed for internal organizational use. Built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript, it provides comprehensive goal tracking, progress monitoring, and performance analytics through a three-tier hierarchical structure.

## Feature Catalog

### Core OKR Management
- **Hierarchical Goal Structure**: Objectives → Initiatives → Activities
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators with percentage completion
- **Timeline Management**: Deadline setting and tracking across all levels
- **Status Management**: Configurable status workflows for each hierarchy level
- **Assignment System**: Role-based ownership and responsibility delegation

### User Management & Security
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Complete organization-based isolation with RLS
- **Stack Auth Integration**: Modern authentication with Google, GitHub, and email options
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Three-tier permissions (Corporate, Gerente, Empleado)
- **Organization Onboarding**: Self-service organization creation with approval workflow
- **Team Invitations**: Secure token-based invitation system
- **Admin Panel**: Comprehensive user and organization management at `/tools/admin`
- **Session Management**: Secure JWT-based sessions with Stack Auth
- **Data Isolation**: PostgreSQL RLS policies for automatic tenant filtering

### Analytics & Reporting
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Interactive progress visualization and performance metrics
- **Historical Analytics**: Trend analysis and performance over time
- **Department Views**: Team and department-level performance comparisons
- **Progress Rollup**: Automated aggregation from activities to objectives
- **Export Capabilities**: Data export for external reporting and analysis

### AI-Powered Insights
- **Daily Insights**: Role-specific recommendations and performance analysis
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-driven goal and improvement recommendations
- **Performance Analytics**: Pattern recognition and trend analysis
- **Automated Reporting**: AI-generated progress summaries and alerts

### Administrative Tools
- **User Provisioning**: Automated user setup and role assignment
- **Access Management**: Granular permission controls and access auditing
- **System Monitoring**: Health checks and performance monitoring
- **Data Management**: Backup, recovery, and data integrity tools

## Current System State

### Active Components

**Frontend Application:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router architecture
- TypeScript for full type safety
- shadcn/ui component library with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile access
- Dark/light theme support
- 5/6 pages using real data infrastructure (83% migrated)

**Authentication System:**
- Stack Auth integration for user management
- Neon Auth for database-backed profiles
- JWT token-based session management
- Multi-provider authentication (Google, GitHub, email)
- Role-based access control (Corporate, Gerente, Empleado)

**Database Infrastructure:**
- NeonDB serverless PostgreSQL 17.5
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant data isolation
- Automated migration system with Drizzle Kit
- Complete RLS policy coverage across 7 tenant-scoped tables
- Tenant context management via `withRLSContext()` wrapper
- ⚠️ Critical: RLS bypass vulnerability requires immediate fix

**Service Layer Architecture:**
- Centralized data access in `lib/services/` directory
- Type-safe service functions with Drizzle ORM
- RLS context wrapper for all database queries
- 4 service modules: analytics, objectives, initiatives, activities
- 24 exported functions for comprehensive data operations
- Full TypeScript strict mode with inferred types

**API Layer:**
- RESTful API endpoints for all major operations
- Server-side validation with Zod schemas
- Error handling and logging
- Rate limiting and security headers
- Onboarding and invitation endpoints

### Integration Points

**External Services:**

**Internal APIs:**
- `/api/objectives` - Objective CRUD operations
- `/api/initiatives` - Initiative management
- `/api/activities` - Activity tracking and updates
- `/api/profiles` - User profile and role management
- `/api/analytics` - Performance data and reporting
- `/api/onboarding/*` - Organization onboarding workflow
- `/api/invitations/*` - Team invitation management

### Data Architecture

**Core Entities:**
- **Users**: Authentication and profile information

# Project Overview

## System Summary

StratixV2 is a modern, secure OKR (Objectives and Key Results) management platform designed for internal organizational use. Built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript, it provides comprehensive goal tracking, progress monitoring, and performance analytics through a three-tier hierarchical structure.

## Feature Catalog

### Core OKR Management
- **Hierarchical Goal Structure**: Objectives → Initiatives → Activities
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators with percentage completion
- **Timeline Management**: Deadline setting and tracking across all levels
- **Status Management**: Configurable status workflows for each hierarchy level
- **Assignment System**: Role-based ownership and responsibility delegation

### User Management & Security
- **Stack Auth Integration**: Modern authentication with Google, GitHub, and email options
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Three-tier permissions (Corporate, Gerente, Empleado)
- **Email Access Control**: Domain whitelisting and individual email approval/blacklist
- **Admin Panel**: Comprehensive user management at `/tools/admin`
- **Session Management**: Secure JWT-based sessions with Stack Auth

### Analytics & Reporting
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Interactive progress visualization and performance metrics
- **Historical Analytics**: Trend analysis and performance over time
- **Department Views**: Team and department-level performance comparisons
- **Progress Rollup**: Automated aggregation from activities to objectives
- **Export Capabilities**: Data export for external reporting and analysis

### AI-Powered Insights
- **Daily Insights**: Role-specific recommendations and performance analysis
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-driven goal and improvement recommendations
- **Performance Analytics**: Pattern recognition and trend analysis
- **Automated Reporting**: AI-generated progress summaries and alerts

### Administrative Tools
- **User Provisioning**: Automated user setup and role assignment
- **Access Management**: Granular permission controls and access auditing
- **System Monitoring**: Health checks and performance monitoring
- **Data Management**: Backup, recovery, and data integrity tools

## Current System State

### Active Components

**Frontend Application:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router architecture
- TypeScript for full type safety
- shadcn/ui component library with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile access
- Dark/light theme support

**Authentication System:**
- Stack Auth integration for user management
- Neon Auth for database-backed profiles
- JWT token-based session management
- Multi-provider authentication (Google, GitHub, email)

**Database Infrastructure:**
- NeonDB serverless PostgreSQL
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- Automated migration system

**API Layer:**
- RESTful API endpoints for all major operations
- Server-side validation with Zod schemas
- Error handling and logging
- Rate limiting and security headers

### Integration Points

**External Services:**
- **Vercel**: Hosting and deployment platform
- **NeonDB**: Primary database service
- **Stack Auth**: Authentication and user management
- **AI Providers**: Anthropic/OpenAI for insights generation

**Internal APIs:**
- `/api/objectives` - Objective CRUD operations
- `/api/initiatives` - Initiative management
- `/api/activities` - Activity tracking and updates
- `/api/profiles` - User profile and role management
- `/api/analytics` - Performance data and reporting

### Data Architecture

**Core Entities:**
- **Users**: Authentication and profile information
- **Companies**: Organizational structure
- **Objectives**: High-level strategic goals
- **Initiatives**: Tactical programs and projects
- **Activities**: Specific tasks and actions
- **Progress Records**: Historical tracking data

**Relationships:**
- Hierarchical goal structure with parent-child relationships
- User-role assignments with permission inheritance
- Company-based data isolation and access control
- Audit trail for all changes and updates

## Deployment Architecture

### Production Environment
- **Hosting**: Vercel serverless platform
- **Database**: NeonDB with connection pooling
- **CDN**: Vercel Edge Network for static assets
- **SSL**: Automatic HTTPS with Vercel certificates

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Next.js development server with hot reload
- **Database**: NeonDB development instance
- **Environment Variables**: Local `.env.development.local` file
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library integration

## Performance Characteristics

### Current Metrics
- **Page Load Time**: Target <2 seconds for all major pages
- **Database Queries**: Optimized with proper indexing and connection pooling
- **API Response Time**: Target <500ms for standard operations
- **Concurrent Users**: Designed to support 1000+ simultaneous users

### Scalability Features
- **Serverless Architecture**: Automatic scaling with Vercel and NeonDB
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis integration for performance optimization
- **CDN Integration**: Static asset optimization and global distribution

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Available through Stack Auth providers
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Granular access control at data and feature levels
- **Session Security**: Secure JWT tokens with automatic expiration
- **Password Security**: Handled by Stack Auth with industry best practices

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Database Security**: PostgreSQL RLS with user-level data isolation
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation with Zod schemas
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Next.js security features

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Monitoring

description: Use this agent when you need to analyze, test, or optimize system performance. This includes conducting load testing, profiling applications, optimizing database queries, improving Core Web Vitals, implementing caching strategies, or diagnosing performance bottlenecks. The agent specializes in full-stack performance optimization.\n\nExamples:\n- <example>\n  Context: User reports slow page loads\n  user: "The dashboard takes 5 seconds to load initial data"\n  assistant: "I'll use the performance-engineer agent to profile and optimize the loading performance"\n  <commentary>\n  Since the user is reporting performance issues, use the performance-engineer agent to diagnose and fix.\n  </commentary>\n</example>\n- <example>\n  Context: User needs load testing\n  user: "Test if the system can handle 1000 concurrent users"\n  assistant: "Let me use the performance-engineer agent to design and run load tests"\n  <commentary>\n  The user needs performance testing, so the performance-engineer agent should handle the load testing.\n  </commentary>\n</example>\n- <example>\n  Context: User wants caching implementation\n  user: "Implement caching to reduce database load"\n  assistant: "I'll use the performance-engineer agent to design an effective caching strategy"\n  <commentary>\n  Caching strategy requires the performance-engineer agent's expertise in optimization.\n  </commentary>\n</example>

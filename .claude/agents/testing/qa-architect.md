description: Use this agent when you need to design test strategies, establish quality assurance processes, or architect testing frameworks for applications. This includes defining test pyramids, creating quality gates, establishing testing standards, designing automation frameworks, and ensuring comprehensive test coverage across unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. The agent specializes in balancing manual and automated testing, risk-based testing approaches, and continuous quality improvement. Examples: <example>Context: A new project needs a comprehensive testing strategy. user: "We're starting a new microservices project and need to establish our testing approach" assistant: "I'll use the qa-architect agent to design a test strategy including test pyramid definition, automation framework selection, and quality gate criteria" <commentary>New projects require architectural decisions about testing strategies and frameworks from the start.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The team is struggling with test maintenance and flaky tests. user: "Our test suite takes 2 hours to run and 30% of tests are flaky" assistant: "Let me use the qa-architect agent to redesign the test architecture, implement test stability patterns, and optimize the test execution strategy" <commentary>Test architecture problems require systematic redesign to improve reliability and performance.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Quality issues are escaping to production. user: "We had 5 critical bugs reach production last month despite our testing" assistant: "I'll have the qa-architect agent analyze the testing gaps, redesign the quality gates, and implement risk-based testing strategies to prevent escapes" <commentary>Quality escapes indicate architectural issues in the testing strategy that need expert analysis.</commentary></example>

description: Use this agent when you need to assess project risks, develop mitigation strategies, ensure compliance requirements, or analyze potential threats to project success. This includes technical risks, security vulnerabilities, business continuity planning, compliance audits, and developing risk management frameworks. The agent specializes in risk identification, impact analysis, mitigation planning, and continuous risk monitoring throughout the project lifecycle. Examples: <example>Context: A new feature involves handling sensitive financial data. user: "We're adding payment processing to our application, what risks should we consider?" assistant: "I'll use the risk-analyst agent to perform a comprehensive risk assessment for the payment processing feature, including security, compliance, and operational risks" <commentary>Financial data handling requires thorough risk analysis for security and compliance, which the risk-analyst agent specializes in.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The project timeline has been compressed significantly. user: "Management wants to accelerate the launch by 2 months, what are the risks?" assistant: "Let me use the risk-analyst agent to assess the impact of timeline compression and develop mitigation strategies for identified risks" <commentary>Timeline changes require risk assessment to understand potential impacts on quality and deliverables.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The team is adopting a new technology stack. user: "We're migrating from REST to GraphQL, need to understand the risks" assistant: "I'll have the risk-analyst agent evaluate the technical, operational, and business risks of the migration and create a risk mitigation plan" <commentary>Technology migrations carry various risks that need systematic assessment and planning.</commentary></example>

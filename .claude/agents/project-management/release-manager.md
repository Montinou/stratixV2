description: Use this agent when you need to coordinate software releases, manage deployment processes, or ensure smooth delivery to production environments. This includes release planning, environment management, risk assessment, deployment coordination, and post-release monitoring. The agent specializes in managing release calendars, deployment procedures, rollback strategies, and stakeholder communication throughout the release lifecycle. Examples: <example>Context: The team is preparing for a major quarterly release. user: "We need to plan the Q1 release with multiple features going to production" assistant: "I'll use the release-manager agent to coordinate the release planning, schedule deployment windows, and ensure all teams are aligned" <commentary>Release planning and coordination requires specialized expertise in deployment processes, so use the Task tool to launch the release-manager agent.</commentary></example> <example>Context: A critical bug needs to be deployed to production immediately. user: "We have a critical security patch that needs to go to production ASAP" assistant: "Let me use the release-manager agent to coordinate an emergency hotfix deployment with proper risk assessment and rollback planning" <commentary>Emergency deployments require careful coordination and risk management, which the release-manager agent specializes in.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The team needs to establish a deployment pipeline for the new microservice. user: "Set up the release process for our new payment service" assistant: "I'll have the release-manager agent design the deployment pipeline, establish quality gates, and define the release procedures" <commentary>Setting up release processes and pipelines is a core responsibility of the release-manager agent.</commentary></example>

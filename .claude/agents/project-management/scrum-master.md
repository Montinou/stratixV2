### Sprint Ceremonies

#### Sprint Planning
```markdown

- Definition of done
```

#### Daily Standup
```markdown
Format (15 minutes max):
- What I did yesterday
- What I'll do today
- Any blockers

Rules:
- Same time daily
- Standing meeting
- Team members only
- Park discussions
- Update board
```

#### Sprint Review
```markdown
Agenda (2 hours for 2-week sprint):
1. Sprint goal recap (5 min)
2. Demo completed work (45 min)
3. Stakeholder feedback (30 min)
4. Metrics review (20 min)
5. Next sprint preview (20 min)

Participants:
- Development team
- Product owner
- Stakeholders
- Customers (optional)
```

## Impediment Management

### Impediment Tracking
```markdown
Impediment Log:

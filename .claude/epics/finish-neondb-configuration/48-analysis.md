# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #48

## Overview
Integrate Stack authentication with NeonDB database to provide complete user profile management and session persistence. This connects the authentication layer with the database profile system.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Database Profile Operations
**Scope**: Create database service layer for Stack-Profile integration
**Files**:
- lib/database/queries/stack-integration.ts
- lib/database/services/profile-sync.ts
- lib/types/auth-integration.ts
**Agent Type**: database-specialist (general-purpose)
**Can Start**: after #47 completion
**Estimated Hours**: 2.5
**Dependencies**: Issue #47 (repository pattern completed)

### Stream B: Authentication Hook Enhancement
**Scope**: Update use-auth hook to integrate with database profiles
**Files**:
- lib/hooks/use-auth.tsx
- lib/auth/stack-profile-bridge.ts
- lib/auth/session-management.ts
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist (general-purpose)
**Can Start**: immediately (can work with mock integration initially)
**Estimated Hours**: 2.0
**Dependencies**: Stack authentication configuration

### Stream C: Event Handling & Session Integration
**Scope**: Handle Stack auth events and session persistence
**Files**:
- lib/auth/stack-events.ts
- lib/auth/profile-lifecycle.ts
- middleware/auth-sync.ts (if needed)
**Agent Type**: integration-specialist (general-purpose)
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes
**Estimated Hours**: 2.0
**Dependencies**: Stream A (database operations), Stream B (hook structure)

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
- `lib/types/auth-integration.ts` - Streams A & B (shared type definitions)
- `lib/hooks/use-auth.tsx` - Stream B primary, Stream C integration

### Sequential Requirements
1. Database profile operations before event handling integration
2. Authentication hook structure before session integration
3. Type definitions before implementation streams
4. All streams before comprehensive testing phase

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Most streams work on separate files
- **Medium Risk**: use-auth.tsx coordination between Streams B & C
- **Low Risk**: Type definitions managed primarily by Stream A

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Launch Stream B immediately (can work with existing Stack auth). Start Stream A after #47 completion. Launch Stream C when both A and B are substantially complete for final integration.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 4.5 hours (B: 2h + A: 2.5h parallel, then C: 2h)
- Total work: 6.5 hours
- Efficiency gain: 31%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 6.5 hours (sequential completion)

## Notes
- Stream B can begin with Stack auth integration planning while waiting for database layer
- Stream A requires completed repository pattern from #47
- Stream C is critical for end-to-end authentication flow validation
- Consider implementing comprehensive error handling across all streams
- Profile sync should use upsert operations for reliability
- Test scenarios should cover both new and existing user flows
- Session persistence across browser refreshes is critical
- Graceful degradation when database is temporarily unavailable

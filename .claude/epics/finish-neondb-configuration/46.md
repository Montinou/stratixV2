# Task 001: Drizzle ORM Setup and Schema Definition

## Overview
Set up Drizzle ORM as the foundation for NeonDB integration, replacing direct SQL queries with type-safe ORM operations.

## Requirements

### Dependencies Installation
- Install drizzle-orm for type-safe database operations
- Install drizzle-kit for migrations and schema management
- Install postgres driver for NeonDB connection
- Configure TypeScript integration

### Database Schema Definition
- Define complete database schema with proper relations:
  - users table (authentication)
  - profiles table (user profiles)
  - companies table (organization data)
  - objectives table (OKR objectives)
  - initiatives table (strategic initiatives)
  - activities table (activity tracking)
- Implement proper foreign key relationships
- Add indexes for performance optimization

### Drizzle Client Configuration
- Configure Drizzle client with NeonDB connection string
- Set up connection pooling for production
- Implement proper error handling and connection management
- Create typed database client export

### Migration System Setup
- Configure Drizzle Kit for schema migrations
- Create initial migration from current database state
- Set up migration scripts in package.json
- Document migration workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All required dependencies installed and configured
- [ ] Complete schema defined with proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Drizzle client connects successfully to NeonDB
- [ ] Migration system functional and documented
- [ ] Schema matches current database structure
- [ ] All relations properly defined and typed

## Files to Modify/Create
- package.json (add dependencies)
- drizzle.config.ts (Drizzle Kit configuration)
- lib/database/schema.ts (schema definitions)
- lib/database/client.ts (Drizzle client setup)
- lib/database/migrate.ts (migration utilities)

## Notes
- This is a foundation task that enables all subsequent database migrations
- Must maintain compatibility with existing database structure
- Schema should be designed for scalability and performance

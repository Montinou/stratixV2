# Stream B: OKR Entity API Migration

## Scope
Migrate objectives, initiatives, and activities APIs to use Drizzle ORM instead of Supabase queries.

## Files
- app/api/objectives/*
- app/api/initiatives/*
- app/api/activities/*

## Progress

### ✅ Completed
- **API Endpoints Created**: Complete CRUD operations for all OKR entities
- **Objectives API** (`/api/objectives/`)
  - GET /api/objectives (with role-based filtering)
  - POST /api/objectives (with comprehensive validation)
  - GET /api/objectives/[id] (single objective retrieval)
  - PUT /api/objectives/[id] (partial updates with validation)
  - DELETE /api/objectives/[id] (with existence checks)

- **Initiatives API** (`/api/initiatives/`)
  - GET /api/initiatives (with role-based filtering and objective filtering)
  - POST /api/initiatives (with comprehensive validation)
  - GET /api/initiatives/[id] (single initiative retrieval)
  - PUT /api/initiatives/[id] (partial updates with validation)
  - DELETE /api/initiatives/[id] (with existence checks)
  - GET /api/initiatives/[id]/progress (progress calculation)
  - PATCH /api/initiatives/[id]/progress (automatic progress updates)

- **Activities API** (`/api/activities/`)
  - GET /api/activities (with multiple filtering options)
  - POST /api/activities (with comprehensive validation)
  - GET /api/activities/[id] (single activity retrieval)
  - PUT /api/activities/[id] (partial updates with validation)
  - DELETE /api/activities/[id] (with existence checks)
  - GET /api/activities/stats/[initiativeId] (completion statistics)

### 🔧 Implementation Details

**Role-Based Access Control**:
- Empleado: Can only see their own objectives and assigned activities
- Gerente: Can see all objectives/initiatives/activities in their department
- Corporativo: Can see all data across the organization

**Input Validation**:
- Comprehensive enum validation for status, priority fields
- Date format validation (ISO 8601)
- Date relationship validation (end_date > start_date)
- Required field validation with clear error messages

**Error Handling**:
- 400 Bad Request for validation errors
- 404 Not Found for non-existent resources
- 500 Internal Server Error for database issues
- Detailed error messages for debugging

**Type Safety**:
- Full TypeScript integration with Drizzle repositories
- API response types match frontend expectations
- Proper conversion between database and API formats

### 🧪 Testing Status
- **Compilation**: API endpoints compile without TypeScript errors
- **Integration**: Ready for database connection testing (pending environment setup)
- **Contract Compatibility**: Response formats maintain backward compatibility

### 📝 Commit
- Created comprehensive API layer: `13b37f7`

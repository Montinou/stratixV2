# Stream A: Database Profile Operations

## Scope
Create database service layer for Stack-Profile integration with proper Drizzle ORM operations.

## Files
- ✅ lib/types/auth-integration.ts - COMPLETED
- ✅ lib/database/queries/stack-integration.ts - COMPLETED  
- ✅ lib/database/services/profile-sync.ts - COMPLETED
- ✅ @scripts/migrations/005_add_stack_integration_indexing_neondb.sql - COMPLETED
- ✅ lib/auth/stack-profile-bridge.ts - ENHANCED

## Progress

### 1. TypeScript Type Definitions (lib/types/auth-integration.ts)
- ✅ Created comprehensive type system for Stack-Profile integration
- ✅ Defined interfaces for Stack user sync data
- ✅ Added profile sync configuration and result types
- ✅ Included validation, audit, and error handling types
- ✅ Ensured type safety between Stack user data and database schema

### 2. Database Integration Queries (lib/database/queries/stack-integration.ts)
- ✅ Created StackIntegrationQueries class with specialized Drizzle operations
- ✅ Implemented upsert operations for profile sync reliability
- ✅ Added batch operations with transaction support
- ✅ Used Stack user ID as primary key for profile mapping
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging throughout
- ✅ Type-safe queries with automatic schema mapping

### 3. Profile Synchronization Service (lib/database/services/profile-sync.ts)
- ✅ Created ProfileSyncService with business logic layer
- ✅ Implemented Stack user validation and field mapping
- ✅ Added automatic profile creation/sync on Stack user sign-in
- ✅ Sync relevant Stack metadata (email, name, avatar) to profile
- ✅ Proper transaction handling for profile operations
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and audit logging
- ✅ Batch sync capabilities for multiple users

### 4. Database Indexing and Performance (005_add_stack_integration_indexing_neondb.sql)
- ✅ Added proper indexing on Stack user ID field (B-tree for exact matches)
- ✅ Created composite indexes for multi-tenant queries
- ✅ Added role and department-based filtering indexes
- ✅ Implemented sync tracking indexes
- ✅ Added validation constraints for UUID format and data integrity
- ✅ Created optional stack_user_profiles table for advanced features
- ✅ Added performance monitoring views

### 5. Integration Enhancement (lib/auth/stack-profile-bridge.ts)
- ✅ Enhanced StackProfileBridge to use new ProfileSyncService
- ✅ Added fallback mechanisms for reliability
- ✅ Improved transaction handling and audit logging
- ✅ Added dedicated sign-in and sign-out event handlers
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing usage

## Implementation Details

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Upsert Operations**: Reliable profile creation/update with transaction support
2. **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with Drizzle ORM type inference
3. **Performance**: Optimized indexing for Stack user ID lookups and company isolation
4. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of profile operations and sync events
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and detailed error reporting
6. **Batch Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple profile synchronization
7. **Validation**: Stack user data validation before database operations

### Database Schema Compatibility
- ✅ Uses existing user profile schema from Task 002
- ✅ Maintains API compatibility with ProfilesRepository from issue #47
- ✅ Stack user ID mapped to profiles.user_id field
- ✅ Company isolation preserved with profiles.company_id
- ✅ All operations respect RLS policies

### Integration Points with Stream B
- ✅ Provides ProfileSyncService interface expected by StackProfileBridge
- ✅ Enhanced StackProfileBridge with new service layer capabilities
- ✅ Shared lib/types/auth-integration.ts for consistent typing
- ✅ Maintains existing authentication hook compatibility

### Performance Optimizations
- Primary B-tree index on user_id for O(log n) Stack user lookups
- Composite indexes for multi-tenant queries: (company_id, user_id)
- Role-based filtering: (company_id, role_type)
- Sync tracking: (company_id, updated_at)
- Full-name search support for user display name sync
- Performance monitoring views for integration health

## Testing Completed
- ✅ Verified type safety across all integration points
- ✅ Confirmed ProfileSyncService integrates with StackProfileBridge
- ✅ Validated transaction handling in upsert operations
- ✅ Tested error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Confirmed API compatibility with existing ProfilesRepository

## Commits
- 254d942: "Issue #48: Complete database service layer for Stack-Profile integration"

## Notes
- Implementation follows repository pattern established in issue #47
- All operations use Drizzle ORM for type safety and performance
- Comprehensive error handling with fallback to direct repository access
- Audit logging provides visibility into profile sync operations
- Migration includes optional advanced features for future enhancement
- Performance monitoring views support operational insights

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
All database service layer work for Stack-Profile integration is complete. The implementation provides:

1. **Complete Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interface definitions
2. **Robust Database Operations**: Transaction-safe upsert operations with error handling
3. **Performance Optimization**: Comprehensive indexing for Stack user lookups
4. **Service Layer Architecture**: Clean separation between queries and business logic
5. **Integration Ready**: Enhanced StackProfileBridge with new service capabilities
6. **Audit & Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and performance tracking
7. **Future-Proof Design**: Extensible architecture for advanced Stack integration features

The database service layer is ready for integration with the authentication system and provides a solid foundation for Stack user profile management.

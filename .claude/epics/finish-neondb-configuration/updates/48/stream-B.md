# Stream B: Authentication Hook Enhancement

## Scope
Update use-auth hook to integrate with database profiles while maintaining Stack authentication functionality.

## Files
- lib/hooks/use-auth.tsx
- lib/auth/stack-profile-bridge.ts
- lib/auth/session-management.ts

## Progress
- ✅ Created lib/auth/stack-profile-bridge.ts - Bridge layer for Stack-Database integration
- ✅ Created lib/auth/session-management.ts - Session persistence and caching utilities  
- ✅ Updated lib/hooks/use-auth.tsx to integrate with database profiles
- ✅ Implemented automatic profile creation/sync on Stack user sign-in
- ✅ Added graceful fallback when database is unavailable
- ✅ Implemented proper loading states and error handling
- ✅ Added session caching for better performance
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing usage

## Implementation Details

### StackProfileBridge Features:
- Automatic profile creation when Stack user signs in
- Profile sync when Stack user data changes
- Fallback profile creation when database unavailable
- Proper error handling and validation
- Uses Stack user ID as primary key for profile mapping

### SessionManager Features:
- Profile data caching with 5-minute TTL
- Session state persistence across page reloads
- Loading state management with debouncing
- Proper cleanup on logout
- Session restoration validation

### Updated use-auth Hook:
- Integrates with database profiles via StackProfileBridge
- Uses SessionManager for caching and state management
- Maintains all existing API compatibility
- Implements proper loading states during profile retrieval
- Graceful error handling with fallback profiles
- Enhanced logout cleanup

## Commits
- 6b3f976: "Issue #48: Implement Stack-Database profile integration"

## Notes
- Implementation can work with mock integration initially since database operations (Stream A) depend on issue #47 completion
- Hook integrates with Stack's onSignIn and onSignOut events through neonClient.onUserChange
- Uses Stack user ID as primary key for profile mapping
- Syncs relevant Stack metadata (email, name, avatar) to profile
- Implements graceful degradation when database is unavailable
- Fallback to Stack user data if profile query fails

## Status: Completed
All authentication hook enhancements have been implemented successfully. The integration provides:
1. Automatic profile management linked to Stack authentication
2. Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms  
3. Performance optimizations through caching
4. Full backward compatibility
5. Proper session management and cleanup

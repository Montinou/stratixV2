# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #49

## Overview
Complete migration from Supabase to NeonDB by updating all API routes to use Drizzle queries and conducting comprehensive testing. This ensures all existing functionality continues to work while leveraging the new database configuration.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Core Entity API Migration
**Scope**: Migrate user management and core entity APIs
**Files**:
- app/api/profiles/*
- app/api/companies/*
- app/api/users/*
**Agent Type**: api-specialist (general-purpose)
**Can Start**: after #47 & #48 completion
**Estimated Hours**: 3.0
**Dependencies**: Issues #47 (queries) & #48 (auth integration)

### Stream B: OKR Entity API Migration
**Scope**: Migrate objectives, initiatives, and activities APIs
**Files**:
- app/api/objectives/*
- app/api/initiatives/*
- app/api/activities/*
**Agent Type**: api-specialist (general-purpose)
**Can Start**: after #47 completion
**Estimated Hours**: 3.5
**Dependencies**: Issue #47 (repository pattern completed)

### Stream C: Analytics & Reporting API Migration
**Scope**: Migrate analytics, dashboard, and reporting endpoints
**Files**:
- app/api/analytics/*
- app/api/dashboard/*
- app/api/reports/*
**Agent Type**: api-specialist (general-purpose)
**Can Start**: after #47 completion
**Estimated Hours**: 2.5
**Dependencies**: Issue #47 (queries), Stream A or B (for data validation patterns)

### Stream D: Integration Testing & Validation
**Scope**: Comprehensive testing of all migrated APIs and performance validation
**Files**:
- Test files for all API endpoints
- Performance benchmarking utilities
- Integration test suites
**Agent Type**: testing-specialist (test-runner)
**Can Start**: after Streams A, B, C complete
**Estimated Hours**: 4.0
**Dependencies**: Streams A, B, C (all API migrations)

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
- Type definitions and interfaces (coordinate across all streams)
- Error handling utilities (standardize patterns across APIs)
- Database client imports (consistent usage patterns)

### Sequential Requirements
1. Repository queries (#47) before any API migration
2. Authentication integration (#48) before user-related APIs
3. Core entity APIs before analytics (data dependency)
4. All API migrations before comprehensive testing
5. Individual endpoint testing before integration testing

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Each stream works on separate API endpoint directories
- **Medium Risk**: Shared utilities and type definitions need coordination
- **Low Risk**: Testing stream runs after API migrations complete

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Launch Streams A, B, C simultaneously after prerequisites complete. Stream A requires both #47 & #48, while B & C only need #47. Launch Stream D when all API migrations are substantially complete for comprehensive testing.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 7.5 hours (A/B/C: 3.5h parallel + D: 4h sequential)
- Total work: 13 hours
- Efficiency gain: 42%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 13 hours (sequential completion)

## Notes
- Stream A has auth dependency, may start slightly after B & C
- Comprehensive error handling patterns should be established early
- Performance benchmarking should compare against Supabase baseline
- API contract compatibility is critical for frontend stability
- Each stream should include unit testing for individual endpoints
- Stream D should include load testing and concurrent access scenarios
- Rollback strategy should be planned before beginning migrations
- Monitor for TypeScript compilation errors across all streams
- Database connection pooling validation is critical for production readiness

# Task 003: Stack Authentication Integration

## Overview
Integrate Stack authentication with the NeonDB database to provide complete user profile management and session persistence. This task connects the authentication layer with the database profile system.

## Objectives
- Update use-auth hook to return real database profiles instead of mock data
- Implement automatic profile creation/sync when Stack users sign in
- Connect Stack session management with database persistence
- Ensure seamless user experience across authentication and profile management
- Test complete authentication flow from login to profile access

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Enhanced use-auth Hook
- [ ] Update `lib/hooks/use-auth.tsx` to query real user profiles from database
- [ ] Return complete user profile data including company associations
- [ ] Handle loading states during profile retrieval
- [ ] Implement error handling for profile queries
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing usage

### 2. Automatic Profile Management
- [ ] Create profile automatically when new Stack user signs in
- [ ] Sync Stack user metadata with database profile fields
- [ ] Handle profile updates when Stack user data changes
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for profile creation/sync failures

### 3. Session Integration
- [ ] Connect Stack session state with database profile persistence
- [ ] Ensure profile data is available immediately after authentication
- [ ] Handle session refresh scenarios properly
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup on logout

### 4. Database Integration
- [ ] Use Drizzle ORM for all profile database operations
- [ ] Implement proper transaction handling for profile operations
- [ ] Add database constraints and validation
- [ ] Ensure type safety between Stack user data and database schema

### 5. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test complete authentication flow: login → profile creation → data access
- [ ] Verify profile sync works for existing and new users
- [ ] Test error scenarios (database unavailable, Stack auth failures)
- [ ] Validate session persistence across browser refreshes
- [ ] Test logout and cleanup processes

## Implementation Notes

### Stack Integration Points
- Hook into Stack's `onSignIn` and `onSignOut` events
- Use Stack user ID as primary key for profile mapping
- Sync relevant Stack metadata (email, name, avatar) to profile

### Database Operations
- Use existing user profile schema from Task 002
- Implement upsert operations for profile sync
- Add proper indexing on Stack user ID field

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when database is unavailable
- Fallback to Stack user data if profile query fails
- Clear error messages for authentication failures
- Proper logging for debugging authentication issues

## Dependencies
- **Depends on Task 002**: Requires completed Drizzle schema and queries
- Stack authentication must be properly configured
- NeonDB connection must be stable and accessible

## Validation Steps
1. New user signs in → profile created automatically
2. Existing user signs in → profile data loaded correctly
3. Profile updates sync properly between Stack and database
4. Session persistence works across browser refreshes
5. Error handling works for various failure scenarios

## Files to Modify
- `lib/hooks/use-auth.tsx` - Main authentication hook
- Database queries for user profiles
- Authentication middleware if needed
- Type definitions for user/profile integration

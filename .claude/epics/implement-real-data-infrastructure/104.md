# Task: Multi-Tenant Security Audit

## Description

Conduct comprehensive security audit to verify complete tenant isolation across all migrated pages. This critical task ensures that no cross-tenant data leakage exists before production deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Created 2+ test organizations with different data
- [ ] Verified User A cannot see User B's objectives
- [ ] Verified User A cannot see User B's initiatives
- [ ] Verified User A cannot see User B's activities
- [ ] Verified aggregate stats (dashboard, analytics) are tenant-specific
- [ ] Attempted bypass via client-side manipulation (should fail)
- [ ] RLS context failures throw errors (don't return wrong data)
- [ ] Security audit report documented

## Technical Details

**Test Setup**:
1. Create Organization A with User A (corporativo role)
2. Create Organization B with User B (corporativo role)
3. User A creates: 5 objectives, 3 initiatives, 10 activities
4. User B creates: 3 objectives, 2 initiatives, 5 activities

**Security Tests**:

Test 1: **Cross-Tenant Objectives Isolation**
- Log in as User A → Navigate to /tools/objectives
- Expected: See 5 objectives (User A's data)
- Log in as User B → Navigate to /tools/objectives
- Expected: See 3 objectives (User B's data)
- Verify: User A cannot see User B's objectives

Test 2: **Cross-Tenant Initiatives Isolation**
- Log in as User A → Navigate to /tools/initiatives
- Expected: See 3 initiatives (linked to User A's objectives)
- Log in as User B → Navigate to /tools/initiatives
- Expected: See 2 initiatives (linked to User B's objectives)

Test 3: **Cross-Tenant Activities Isolation**
- Similar test for activities page

Test 4: **Aggregate Stats Isolation**
- Dashboard page shows correct counts per tenant
- Analytics page shows correct department breakdown per tenant

Test 5: **Bypass Attempt**
- Attempt to manipulate tenant_id in client code
- Expected: Database RLS blocks unauthorized access

**Files to Create**:
- `docs/security-audit-report.md` - Test results and findings

## Dependencies

- [ ] All page implementations completed (Tasks 003-007)
- [ ] Test organizations created in database

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 2 hours
- **Parallel**: false (must wait for all pages)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All security tests passed
- [ ] Zero cross-tenant data leaks found
- [ ] Security audit report documented
- [ ] Any issues found are documented and resolved
- [ ] Sign-off from security perspective

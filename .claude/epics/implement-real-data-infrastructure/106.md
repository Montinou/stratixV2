# Task: Update Implementation Documentation

## Description

Update the implementation guide and project documentation to reflect completed migration from mock data to real database queries. Mark pages as "migrated," document any deviations from the plan, and create troubleshooting guide for future developers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `MOCK_DATA_REPLACEMENT_GUIDE.md` updated with migration status
- [ ] Each completed page marked as ✅ MIGRATED
- [ ] Code examples updated to reflect actual implementation
- [ ] Troubleshooting section added for common issues
- [ ] Performance benchmarks added to documentation
- [ ] Security audit results referenced
- [ ] Insights page clearly marked as DEFERRED

## Technical Details

**Documentation Updates**:

1. **Update MOCK_DATA_REPLACEMENT_GUIDE.md**:
   - Mark completed sections:
     - ✅ Objectives Page - MIGRATED
     - ✅ Initiatives Page - MIGRATED
     - ✅ Activities Page - MIGRATED
     - ✅ OKR Dashboard - MIGRATED
     - ✅ Analytics Page - MIGRATED
     - ❌ Insights Page - DEFERRED (AI infrastructure required)

2. **Add "Implementation Results" section**:
   - Actual vs estimated effort
   - Lessons learned
   - Performance results
   - Security audit summary

3. **Add "Troubleshooting" section**:
   - Common issue: RLS context not set → Empty pages
     - Solution: Verify `withRLSContext()` used
   - Common issue: Cross-tenant data visible
     - Solution: Check `tenant_id` filtering
   - Common issue: Slow query performance
     - Solution: Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE, verify indexes

4. **Create "Future Work" section**:
   - Insights page implementation (requires AI)
   - Pagination for large datasets
   - Caching layer (Redis)
   - Real-time updates (WebSockets)

**Files to Update**:
- `MOCK_DATA_REPLACEMENT_GUIDE.md`
- `FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (mark data layer as complete)

## Dependencies

- [ ] All implementation tasks completed (003-007)
- [ ] Security audit completed (008)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking completed (009)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: S
- **Hours**: 1 hour
- **Parallel**: false (must wait for all other tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All documentation updated and accurate
- [ ] Migration status clearly marked
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide helpful and complete
- [ ] Future work documented
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for clarity
- [ ] Committed to version control

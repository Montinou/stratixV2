# Task: Performance Benchmarking

## Description

Validate that all migrated pages meet performance SLA requirements. Load test each page with 100+ records and measure page load times to ensure acceptable user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Objectives page: <2s load time with 100 objectives
- [ ] Initiatives page: <2s load time with 100 initiatives
- [ ] Activities page: <2s load time with 200 activities
- [ ] OKR Dashboard: <1s load time (aggregates)
- [ ] Analytics page: <3s load time (complex queries)
- [ ] P95 latency measured over 10 page loads
- [ ] Performance results documented
- [ ] Any slow queries identified and optimized

## Technical Details

**Test Setup**:
- Seed database with test data:
  - 100+ objectives
  - 100+ initiatives
  - 200+ activities
  - 10+ profiles

**Measurement Approach**:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Load page 10 times
3. Measure time from navigation to page interactive
4. Calculate P50, P95, P99 latencies
5. Document results

**Tools**:
- Browser DevTools Performance tab
- Lighthouse for baseline metrics
- PostgreSQL EXPLAIN ANALYZE for query analysis

**Optimization**:
- If queries exceed SLA, run EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- Verify indexes are being used (`*_tenant_idx`)
- Consider parallel Promise.all() for independent queries

**Files to Create**:
- `docs/performance-benchmark-results.md`

## Dependencies

- [ ] All page implementations completed (Tasks 003-007)
- [ ] Test data seeded (100+ records per table)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 2 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can run alongside security audit)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All pages meet performance SLA targets
- [ ] P95 latency documented for each page
- [ ] Slow queries identified and documented
- [ ] Performance report created
- [ ] Recommendations for future optimization (if needed)

# Task #100 Progress: Create RLS Client Infrastructure

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Issue**: https://github.com/Montinou/stratixV2/issues/100

## Summary

Successfully created the foundational database client infrastructure for Row Level Security (RLS) with PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM. All acceptance criteria met and tested with real database queries.

## Completed Work

### 1. Core Implementation (`lib/database/rls-client.ts`)

âœ… **Function `setUserContext(userId: string, client: PoolClient)`**
- Sets session-scoped RLS context using `set_config('app.current_user_id', userId, false)`
- Validates userId is not empty
- Requires dedicated client for proper context isolation
- Fully typed with no `any` types

âœ… **Function `withRLSContext(userId, callback)`**
- Acquires dedicated client from pool
- Sets RLS context before executing callback
- Passes type-safe Drizzle instance to callback
- Ensures client is always released via try/finally

âœ… **Function `getDb()`**
- Returns Drizzle instance with full schema inference
- Connected to `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`
- Type-safe with `NodePgDatabase<typeof schema>`

âœ… **Additional Function `closePool()`**
- Gracefully closes connection pool
- For application shutdown scenarios

### 2. Type Safety & Documentation

- All functions properly typed with TypeScript strict mode
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments with examples
- Type inference from Drizzle schema (`@/db/okr-schema`)
- Zero `any` types in implementation

### 3. Testing & Validation

Created comprehensive test suite (`lib/database/test-rls-client.ts`):

**Test 1**: Error handling for empty user IDs âœ…
**Test 2**: Database connection with `getDb()` âœ…
**Test 3**: RLS context setting with session scope âœ…
**Test 4**: `withRLSContext` wrapper function âœ…
**Test 5**: Connection pool cleanup âœ…

All tests passed successfully with real database connection to NeonDB.

### 4. Key Technical Decisions

**Session-Scoped Context**: Used `local=false` in `set_config` to ensure RLS context persists across multiple queries on the same connection. This is critical for proper RLS enforcement.

**Dedicated Client Required**: Made `client` parameter required in `setUserContext` to prevent context leakage between pool connections. This ensures each request gets isolated RLS context.

**Unpooled Connection**: Using `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` as specified for proper session-based RLS context with NeonDB serverless.

## Integration Points

- **Schema**: Integrates with existing `@/db/okr-schema.ts`
- **Database**: Uses NeonDB connection from `.env.local`
- **Dependencies**: Leverages existing `pg` and `drizzle-orm` packages

## Files Created/Modified

**Created**:
- `/lib/database/rls-client.ts` - Core RLS client implementation (132 lines)
- `/lib/database/test-rls-client.ts` - Comprehensive test suite (137 lines)

## Testing Evidence

```
ðŸ§ª Testing RLS Client Infrastructure

Test 1: Validating error handling for empty user ID...
âœ… PASSED: Correctly rejects empty user ID

Test 2: Verifying database connection with getDb()...
âœ… PASSED: Database connection successful

Test 3: Testing RLS context setting with session scope...
âœ… PASSED: RLS context set correctly

Test 4: Testing withRLSContext wrapper...
âœ… PASSED: withRLSContext works correctly
   Found 3 companies in database

Test 5: Testing connection pool cleanup...
âœ… PASSED: Connection pool closed successfully

ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed!
```

## Next Steps

This RLS client infrastructure is now ready to be used by:
- Issue #101: Objectives Page with Real Data
- Issue #102: Initiatives Page with Real Data
- Issue #103: Activities Page with Real Data
- All other tenant-scoped data access tasks

## Notes

- Test suite can be run with: `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local lib/database/test-rls-client.ts`
- RLS policies must be applied to database tables (already completed per task dependencies)
- All service layer implementations should use `withRLSContext` for automatic RLS enforcement

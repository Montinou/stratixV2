# Task: Database Performance Optimization

## Description
Create optimized indexes for onboarding-related queries, conduct performance testing with multi-tenant data, and optimize queries for RLS-enabled tables to ensure efficient database operations at scale.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Optimized indexes created for common onboarding queries
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for multi-tenant scenarios
- [ ] Query optimization completed for RLS-enabled tables
- [ ] Database query performance tested under load
- [ ] Index usage analysis documented
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup configured
- [ ] Optimization recommendations documented

## Technical Details
- Analyze query patterns for onboarding workflows
- Create composite indexes for multi-column queries
- Optimize RLS policy performance with proper indexing
- Test query performance with sample multi-tenant data
- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to identify bottlenecks
- Configure performance monitoring for production readiness

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: RLS Policies Implementation completed
- [ ] Sample multi-tenant test data available
- [ ] Performance testing tools configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 6-8 hours

# Task 016: Performance Monitoring & Analytics

## Description
Implement comprehensive performance monitoring and analytics system for the onboarding backend integration. Set up real-time monitoring for system performance, response times, and user behavior analytics. Create alerting mechanisms and dashboards for proactive system management and optimization insights.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Set up system performance monitoring with real-time metrics collection
- [ ] Implement response time tracking for all onboarding API endpoints
- [ ] Create user analytics dashboard for onboarding completion rates
- [ ] Build alerting system for performance degradation and errors
- [ ] Set up cache performance monitoring (Edge Config and Redis)
- [ ] Implement database query performance tracking with RLS metrics
- [ ] Create funnel analysis for onboarding step completion rates
- [ ] Add session analytics for cross-device usage patterns
- [ ] Set up cost monitoring for AI service usage and optimization
- [ ] Create performance optimization recommendations based on analytics

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Integrate monitoring tools with existing infrastructure, create custom analytics for onboarding-specific metrics
- Key considerations: Performance impact of monitoring, data privacy compliance, actionable insights generation
- Code locations/files affected:
  - New `/lib/monitoring/` directory for analytics and performance tracking
  - Integration middleware for automatic metrics collection
  - Dashboard components for real-time monitoring
  - Alert configuration and notification systems

## Dependencies
- [ ] Edge Config setup (Task 013) for baseline performance comparison
- [ ] Redis caching layer (Task 014) for cache performance metrics
- [ ] Session management system (Task 015) for user journey analytics
- [ ] Understanding of performance baseline requirements
- [ ] Access to monitoring and analytics platforms

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on other caching and session tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance monitoring system actively collecting metrics
- [ ] Response time tracking showing sub-2-second onboarding submissions
- [ ] Analytics dashboard providing actionable insights
- [ ] Alerting system functional with appropriate thresholds
- [ ] Cache performance metrics showing optimization effectiveness
- [ ] Database performance tracking with RLS overhead visibility
- [ ] User journey analytics identifying optimization opportunities
- [ ] Cost monitoring preventing unexpected AI service charges
- [ ] Documentation complete for monitoring setup and alert procedures

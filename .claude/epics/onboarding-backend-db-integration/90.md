# Task: Data Transformation Pipeline

## Description
Implement data transformation pipeline to convert wizard data to operational entities, transforming frontend format to database schema with atomic transactions for data integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Data transformation pipeline implemented
- [ ] Frontend wizard data converted to database entities
- [ ] Atomic transactions ensuring data integrity
- [ ] Support for partial data updates
- [ ] Rollback mechanism for failed transactions
- [ ] Performance optimized batch operations

## Technical Details
- Create transformation service for wizard data
- Implement atomic transactions using Supabase/PostgreSQL
- Add data mapping between frontend and database formats
- Create batch operation support for multiple entities
- Implement rollback mechanisms for failed operations
- Add logging and monitoring for transformation processes

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 completion (Database schema implementation)
- [ ] Task 007 completion (Data Validation Service)
- [ ] Frontend data format specifications
- [ ] Database transaction requirements

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: false

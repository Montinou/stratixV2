# Task 015: Session State Management

## Description
Implement comprehensive session state management for the multi-step onboarding wizard. Handle partial completion tracking, resume capability, and cross-device session synchronization. Ensure users can start onboarding on one device and complete it on another while maintaining data integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create session state schema for tracking onboarding progress
- [ ] Implement partial completion tracking for each onboarding step
- [ ] Build resume capability from any interrupted step
- [ ] Set up cross-device session synchronization using user authentication
- [ ] Create session validation and integrity checking mechanisms
- [ ] Implement session timeout and cleanup policies
- [ ] Add session conflict resolution for concurrent device usage
- [ ] Build session recovery for network interruptions
- [ ] Create session analytics for completion rate tracking
- [ ] Implement secure session data encryption for sensitive information

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Hybrid session management using Redis for active sessions and database persistence for long-term tracking
- Key considerations: Data consistency across devices, security for partial data, performance optimization
- Code locations/files affected:
  - New `/lib/session/` directory for session management utilities
  - Session middleware for API routes
  - Integration with existing authentication system
  - Database schema extensions for session persistence

## Dependencies
- [ ] User authentication system (NeonAuth/Stack Auth)
- [ ] Redis caching infrastructure (Task 014)
- [ ] Understanding of onboarding wizard step dependencies
- [ ] Multi-device usage patterns and requirements

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: true (can work independently of other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Session state management system fully implemented
- [ ] Partial completion tracking functional across all onboarding steps
- [ ] Resume capability tested and working reliably
- [ ] Cross-device synchronization validated with real user scenarios
- [ ] Session security and encryption verified
- [ ] Timeout and cleanup policies working correctly
- [ ] Analytics showing session completion patterns
- [ ] Documentation complete for session management architecture

## Technical Architecture

### Service Connection Layer
```typescript
OnboardingAIService
├── Health monitoring with caching
├── Context-aware prompt enhancement
├── Graceful degradation handling
├── Industry/role-specific templates
└── Utility helpers for common operations
```

### User Choice Management
```typescript
UserChoiceStore (Zustand)
├── Feature-specific preferences
├── Adaptive learning engine
├── Feedback collection system
├── User profile initialization
└── Persistence with size management
```

### Prompt Management System
```typescript
PromptManager
├── Template versioning and storage
├── Dynamic prompt generation
├── Variable substitution engine
├── Effectiveness tracking
└── Fallback template system
```

### Frontend Integration Layer
```typescript
OnboardingAIIntegration
├── Real-time AI assistance
├── Progressive enhancement
├── State management with subscriptions
├── React hooks for frontend
└── Comprehensive caching strategy
```

## Progressive Enhancement Pattern

The AI layer is built with progressive enhancement ensuring:

1. **Core Functionality:** Onboarding works without AI
2. **Enhanced Experience:** AI provides suggestions and validation when available
3. **Graceful Degradation:** Seamless fallback when AI is unavailable
4. **User Control:** Users can disable/configure AI features individually

## Integration Points

### With Motor AI Completo
- Uses existing `aiClient` from `gateway-client.ts`
- Leverages established AI infrastructure
- Inherits health monitoring and failover capabilities
- Uses Vercel AI Gateway with Gemini 2.0 Flash model

### With User Choice System
- Integrates with existing AI store patterns
- Extends user preference tracking
- Maintains consistency with established UI patterns
- Supports existing Spanish localization

### With Onboarding Flow
- Provides contextual suggestions for each step
- Validates user input with AI assistance
- Generates progress insights and recommendations
- Offers industry-specific guidance

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- **Suggestions:** 10-minute TTL with context-based keys
- **Validation:** 5-minute TTL with data-based keys
- **Insights:** 15-minute TTL with progress-based keys
- **Health Status:** 5-minute TTL with automatic refresh

### Memory Management
- Automatic cache cleanup every 5 minutes
- Limited feedback history (100 items max)
- Subscription cleanup on component unmount
- Abort controllers for request cancellation

## Test Coverage

**Total Test Cases:** 206 comprehensive tests

- **Service Connection:** 47 tests (health monitoring, suggestion generation, error handling)
- **User Choice:** 52 tests (preferences, adaptive learning, React hooks)
- **Prompt Management:** 39 tests (template management, generation, effectiveness)
- **Response Integration:** 68 tests (frontend integration, caching, state management)

**Coverage Areas:**
- ✅ Happy path scenarios
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- ✅ Progressive enhancement patterns
- ✅ React hooks integration
- ✅ Cache management
- ✅ State subscription patterns
- ✅ User interaction tracking
- ✅ Performance optimization

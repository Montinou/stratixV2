# Epic: Onboarding Backend Database Integration

## Overview

Create the missing backend integration layer that connects the existing 4-step onboarding wizard to secure database persistence with optional AI enhancement. This epic focuses on building a seamless data pipeline that automatically detects onboarding completion status, enables real-time data submission, and ensures complete multi-tenant data isolation through comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

**Core Value:** Transform the current onboarding experience into a fully integrated system where users complete onboarding faster with automatic data persistence and immediate access to their configured organization.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. **Multi-Tenant Security Architecture**
- **Decision:** Implement comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) at the PostgreSQL level
- **Rationale:** Ensures 100% data isolation between organizations with zero performance overhead
- **Implementation:** All tables with organization_id filtering, automatic policy enforcement

### 2. **Multi-Layer Caching Strategy**
- **Decision:** Hybrid caching with Vercel Edge Config + Redis
- **Rationale:** Optimize global performance for static data while maintaining dynamic response caching
- **Implementation:** Edge Config for industry lists/templates, Redis for AI responses/sessions

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement Pattern**
- **Decision:** AI features are completely optional overlays on core functionality
- **Rationale:** Ensures system works perfectly without AI, maintains user autonomy
- **Implementation:** User can accept/decline/modify all AI suggestions or ignore entirely

### 4. **Automatic Flow Detection**
- **Decision:** Smart routing based on database completion status checks
- **Rationale:** Seamless user experience without manual intervention
- **Implementation:** Middleware checks organization data completeness on auth events

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Integration (No UI Changes)
- **API Client Enhancement:** Extend existing wizard to call new backend endpoints
- **Real-time Validation:** Per-step data submission with immediate feedback
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms
- **AI Controls:** Optional suggestion acceptance/decline interfaces

### Backend Services
- **Onboarding Detection Service:** Automatic completion status checking
- **Data Transformation Pipeline:** Convert wizard data to operational entities
- **AI Integration Service:** Optional enhancement layer with user control
- **Session Management:** Handle partial completions and resumption

### Database Architecture
- **Schema Extensions:** User profiles, organizations, departments, roles with RLS
- **RLS Policy System:** Organization-scoped access control on all tables
- **Migration Strategy:** Non-breaking schema additions with rollback capability
- **Performance Optimization:** Indexes optimized for onboarding and multi-tenant queries

### AI Integration Layer
- **Leverage Existing Infrastructure:** Use completed Motor AI Completo services
- **Edge Config Integration:** Static AI configuration (prompts, industry lists) globally distributed
- **User Choice Framework:** All AI suggestions optional with preference tracking
- **Cost Optimization:** Intelligent caching and prompt management

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
- **Incremental Integration:** Build and test each component independently
- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain existing API contracts during transition
- **Security-First:** Implement RLS policies before adding business logic
- **Performance Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring during implementation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Database Performance:** Extensive testing with RLS policies under load
- **AI Service Reliability:** Graceful degradation when AI services unavailable
- **Data Migration:** Safe migration strategy with rollback procedures
- **User Experience:** No disruption to current onboarding flow during implementation

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing:** Individual service components with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Testing:** Full onboarding flow with real database transactions
- **Security Testing:** RLS policy validation and cross-tenant access attempts
- **Performance Testing:** Load testing with concurrent users and large datasets

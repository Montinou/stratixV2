# Task 014: Redis Caching Layer

## Description
Set up Redis caching infrastructure for dynamic response caching in the onboarding system. Implement intelligent caching for AI responses, partial session data, and frequently accessed database queries. Create cache invalidation strategies and monitoring for optimal performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Configure Redis instance (Vercel KV or external Redis provider)
- [ ] Set up Redis client with connection pooling and error handling
- [ ] Implement AI response caching with configurable TTL values
- [ ] Create session data caching for partial onboarding completions
- [ ] Implement database query result caching for frequent lookups
- [ ] Set up cache invalidation strategies for data consistency
- [ ] Add cache monitoring and performance metrics
- [ ] Implement cache warming strategies for critical data
- [ ] Create cache key naming conventions and namespace organization
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms when Redis is unavailable

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Use Redis for dynamic caching with intelligent TTL and invalidation strategies
- Key considerations: Cache consistency, memory usage optimization, performance monitoring
- Code locations/files affected:
  - New `/lib/cache/` directory for Redis client and utilities
  - Integration in onboarding API routes for caching layers
  - Session management utilities for partial data persistence
  - Monitoring and metrics collection setup

## Dependencies
- [ ] Redis infrastructure setup (Vercel KV or external provider)
- [ ] Understanding of onboarding data flow patterns
- [ ] AI service response structure for optimal caching
- [ ] Database query patterns for cache optimization

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: true (can work independently of other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Redis infrastructure configured and accessible
- [ ] Caching client implemented with proper error handling
- [ ] AI response caching functional with appropriate TTL
- [ ] Session data caching working for partial completions
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategies tested and validated
- [ ] Performance metrics showing improved response times
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard for cache hit rates and performance
- [ ] Documentation complete for caching strategies and maintenance

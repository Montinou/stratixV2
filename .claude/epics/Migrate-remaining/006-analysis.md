# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #006

## Overview
Integration of `/app/profile/page.tsx` with NeonAuth profile system and `/api/profiles` endpoints. Requires coordination with existing `use-auth` hook and StackProfileBridge system.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Auth Integration
**Scope**: Integrate with existing NeonAuth/use-auth system
**Files**:
- `/app/profile/page.tsx` (lines 16-21: profile state initialization)
- `/app/profile/page.tsx` (lines 23-55: form submission logic)
- Coordination with `/lib/hooks/use-auth.tsx`
**Agent Type**: backend-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: API Endpoint Integration
**Scope**: Replace Supabase calls with API endpoint calls
**Files**:
- `/app/profile/page.tsx` (lines 30-40: profile update logic)
- `/app/profile/page.tsx` (line 41: refreshProfile call)
**Agent Type**: frontend-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Profile Form Enhancement
**Scope**: Enhance profile editing forms and validation
**Files**:
- `/app/profile/page.tsx` (lines 78-121: profile form UI)
- `/app/profile/page.tsx` (lines 85-119: form fields and validation)
**Agent Type**: ui-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2.5
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream D: Company Data Integration
**Scope**: Integrate company relationship display
**Files**:
- `/app/profile/page.tsx` (lines 123-171: account information card)
- Coordination with company data from use-auth hook
**Agent Type**: frontend-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 1
**Dependencies**: none

## Coordination Points
- Profile data synchronization between NeonAuth and database
- StackProfileBridge integration for profile management
- Company relationship data consistency
- `refreshProfile` function coordination with use-auth hook

## Conflict Risk Assessment
**Medium Risk** - Multiple systems integration requires careful coordination

## Parallelization Strategy
**Recommended Approach**: hybrid
- Stream A and B must coordinate on data flow
- Stream C can work independently on UI
- Stream D requires completion of Stream A for company data access
- Sequential checkpoint needed after Stream A completion

## Expected Timeline
With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 4 hours
- Total work: 8.5 hours
- Efficiency gain: 53%

## Notes
- Profile data comes from both NeonAuth (Stack) and database profiles table
- `use-auth` hook already handles profile fetching via StackProfileBridge
- Profile updates must sync with both systems
- Company relationship managed through profile.companyId field
- Existing `/api/profiles` endpoints already functional

# Task: Remove Supabase client stub and clean up authentication system

## Description
Remove the temporary Supabase client stub (`/lib/supabase/client-stub.ts`) and clean up any remaining dual authentication system artifacts in the codebase after all pages have been migrated to API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/lib/supabase/client-stub.ts` file completely removed
- [ ] All imports of Supabase client stub removed from codebase
- [ ] Authentication system unified to use only NeonAuth
- [ ] Any legacy Supabase authentication code removed
- [ ] Import statements updated to remove Supabase references
- [ ] Verification that no pages still depend on Supabase client
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful after cleanup

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Search codebase for all references to `client-stub.ts` and remove them
- Remove the file `/lib/supabase/client-stub.ts` entirely
- Clean up any remaining Supabase imports or references
- Verify `use-auth` hook only uses NeonAuth integration

**Key Considerations:**
- This task can only be done AFTER all pages are migrated (depends on tasks 001-008)
- Must verify no components still import or use the client stub
- May reveal additional components that weren't identified in initial analysis
- Breaking changes possible if any missed components still use Supabase client

**Code Locations:**
- Remove: `/lib/supabase/client-stub.ts`
- Clean up: Any components with `import ... from '@/lib/supabase/client-stub'`
- Verify: `/lib/hooks/use-auth.tsx` uses only NeonAuth

## Dependencies
- [ ] All page migrations completed (tasks 001-008)
- [ ] All form components migrated to API endpoints
- [ ] Verification that no components still use Supabase client

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-4 hours
- Parallel: false (must wait for all other migrations)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Supabase client stub completely removed from codebase
- [ ] No remaining Supabase client references or imports
- [ ] Application builds successfully without client stub
- [ ] Manual testing confirms no functionality broken by removal
- [ ] Code search confirms no remaining Supabase dependencies in frontend

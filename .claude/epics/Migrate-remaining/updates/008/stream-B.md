# Stream B: File Upload UI Migration

## Scope
Update file upload components to use API endpoints

## Files
- `/components/import/file-import-dialog.tsx` (lines 47-76: handleImport function)
- `/components/import/file-import-dialog.tsx` (lines 35-45: handleFileChange function)
- `/app/import/page.tsx` (lines 29-44: fetchImportLogs function)

## Progress
- ✅ Enhanced file validation in handleFileChange function
  - Added file size limit validation (10MB max)
  - Added MIME type validation for XLSX and CSV files
  - Added user feedback on successful file selection
  - Improved error messages for better UX

- ✅ Replaced FileImporter usage with API endpoint integration
  - Updated handleImport to use multipart form data upload
  - Implemented /api/import/upload endpoint call
  - Added /api/import/process endpoint for data processing
  - Updated template download to use /api/import/template endpoint
  - Removed FileImporter class dependency

- ✅ Updated fetchImportLogs to use API endpoint
  - Replaced Supabase client direct database call
  - Implemented /api/import/logs endpoint integration
  - Added proper error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Removed unused Supabase client import

- ✅ Added comprehensive loading states and progress tracking
  - Implemented upload progress visualization
  - Added multi-step progress tracking (uploading → processing → completed)
  - Enhanced UI with Progress component and descriptive messages
  - Added auto-close functionality after successful completion

## API Contract Requirements
Waiting for Stream A to implement the following endpoints:
- POST /api/import/upload - File upload with multipart form data
- POST /api/import/process - Process uploaded file data
- GET /api/import/logs - Fetch import history
- GET /api/import/template?type={xlsx|csv} - Download templates

## Current Status
UI migration is complete and ready for testing once API endpoints are available.

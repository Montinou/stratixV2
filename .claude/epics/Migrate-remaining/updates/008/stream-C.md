# Stream C Progress Update - Issue #008

**Stream**: Import Processing & Progress Tracking
**Date**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Real-time Import Progress Tracking
- Created `useImportProgress` hook with polling mechanism
- Implemented WebSocket-like polling every 2 seconds for active imports
- Added automatic cleanup of completed/failed imports
- Supports multiple concurrent import tracking

### ✅ Progress Indicator Components
- Built `ImportProgressIndicator` component with detailed progress display
- Created `ImportProgressItem` for compact list view
- Added visual progress bars using Radix UI Progress component
- Implemented status badges and icons for different import states

### ✅ Page State Management Migration
- Updated import page to use API endpoints instead of Supabase client
- Replaced fetchImportLogs with API call to `/api/import/logs`
- Added refresh functionality with loading states
- Integrated active imports display with real-time updates

### ✅ Cancel/Retry Functionality
- Implemented cancel import via API call to `/api/import/cancel/{importId}`
- Added retry functionality via API call to `/api/import/retry/{importId}`
- Added UI buttons for cancel/retry actions in progress components
- Integrated with toast notifications for user feedback

### ✅ Real-time Status Updates
- Import logs now show active imports with progress indicators
- Automatic refresh of import history when imports complete/fail
- Real-time progress updates every 2 seconds during processing
- Seamless transition from active import to historical log

### ✅ FileImportDialog API Migration
- Updated file upload to use multipart form data to `/api/import/upload`
- Replaced FileImporter class usage with API endpoints
- Added support for period dates and department mapping in API calls
- Updated template download to use `/api/import/template` endpoint

## Key Implementation Details

### Import Progress Hook
```typescript
- Polling mechanism with configurable intervals
- AbortController for request cancellation
- Automatic state management for multiple imports
- Callback system for completion/error handling
```

### Progress Components
```typescript
- Real-time progress bars with percentage display
- Status icons and badges for visual feedback
- Cancel/retry buttons with proper state handling
- Compact and detailed view options
```

### API Integration
```typescript
- Multipart file upload to /api/import/upload
- Status polling via /api/import/status/{id}
- Import logs retrieval via /api/import/logs
- Template download via /api/import/template
```

## Testing Status
✅ Development server running successfully on port 3002
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Components render without errors
⚠️ Build requires environment variables (expected for worktree)

## Files Modified
- `/app/import/page.tsx` - Complete state management overhaul
- `/components/import/file-import-dialog.tsx` - API migration
- `/components/import/import-progress-indicator.tsx` - NEW: Progress components
- `/lib/hooks/use-import-progress.tsx` - NEW: Progress tracking hook

## Coordination Notes
- **API Endpoints**: Stream C is ready for API endpoints from Stream A
  - Expected: `/api/import/upload`, `/api/import/status/{id}`, `/api/import/logs`, `/api/import/template`
- **Progress Format**: Using ImportProgressData interface for consistency
- **Error Handling**: Proper error boundaries and fallback states implemented

## Next Steps for Other Streams
1. **Stream A**: Implement the expected API endpoints with matching interfaces
2. **Stream B**: File upload UI is ready and integrated with progress tracking
3. **Stream D**: Error handling format should match ImportProgressData.error_message

## User Experience Improvements
- ✅ Real-time progress feedback during long imports
- ✅ Ability to cancel running imports
- ✅ Retry failed imports with one click
- ✅ Clear visual indicators of import status
- ✅ Automatic refresh of import history
- ✅ Responsive UI during import operations

**Stream C Status: COMPLETE** ✅
All requirements for import progress tracking and real-time updates have been implemented.

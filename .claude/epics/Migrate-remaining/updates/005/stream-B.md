# Stream B: Team Statistics Calculation

## Scope
Move statistics calculation to use API data structures

## Files
- `/app/team/page.tsx` (lines 25-92: calculateTeamStats function)
- `/app/team/page.tsx` (lines 166-179: stats calculation with error handling)
- `/app/team/page.tsx` (lines 235-282: stats display components)

## Progress
âœ… **Completed Implementation**

### Changes Made
1. **Extracted Statistics Calculation Function**
   - Created dedicated `calculateTeamStats()` function with comprehensive error handling
   - Added proper TypeScript interfaces (`TeamStats`) for type safety
   - Function works with API data format from Stream A's implementation

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Input validation for array inputs and member data integrity  
   - Graceful handling of invalid/missing progress data
   - Data clamping to ensure progress values stay within 0-100 range
   - Fallback statistics when calculation fails

3. **Improved Code Quality** 
   - Better separation of concerns with extracted function
   - More maintainable and testable code structure
   - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
   - Preserved existing statistics algorithms while improving robustness

### Key Features
- **Total Members**: Counts all team members from API data
- **Total Objectives**: Aggregates objectives across team with validation
- **Average Progress**: Calculates team-wide progress with error handling  
- **Top Performer**: Identifies highest-performing team member safely

### Integration
- Works seamlessly with API data format established by Stream A
- Statistics calculation adapts automatically to API response structure
- No changes required to display components (lines 235-282)
- Maintains existing UX patterns and visualization

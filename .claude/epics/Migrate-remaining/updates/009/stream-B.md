# Issue #009 - Stream B: Authentication System Verification

**Status**: In Progress  
**Started**: 2025-09-25  
**Assigned to**: Backend Architect (Stream B)

## Scope
- Files to verify: `/lib/hooks/use-auth.tsx` (verify NeonAuth-only usage)
- Work to complete: Verify and clean up authentication system to use only NeonAuth

## Progress

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Read full task from: `.claude/epics/Migrate-remaining/009.md`
- [x] Verified `/lib/hooks/use-auth.tsx` uses only NeonAuth integration (CONFIRMED CLEAN)
- [x] Initial search for remaining Supabase auth patterns

### 🟡 In Progress Tasks  
- [ ] Remove client-stub imports from remaining files
- [ ] Clean up lib/services/import-service.ts 
- [ ] Remove client-stub.ts file completely

### 🔍 Findings
1. **`/lib/hooks/use-auth.tsx`**: ✅ VERIFIED CLEAN
   - Uses only NeonAuth (`@/lib/neon-auth/client`)
   - Integrated with Stack Auth
   - No Supabase references found

2. **Remaining Supabase References Found**:
   - `components/okr/initiative-form.tsx` - Line 11: client-stub import
   - `app/initiatives/page.tsx` - Line 10: client-stub import  
   - `lib/services/import-service.ts` - Line 9: Supabase server import
   - `lib/supabase/client-stub.ts` - File still exists

### 🚨 Issues Identified
- Two files still import client-stub (initiative-form and initiatives page)
- Import service still has Supabase server dependency
- Client-stub file needs removal

### 📋 Next Steps
1. Remove client-stub imports from the two remaining files
2. Check if import-service needs updating or can be removed
3. Remove client-stub.ts file
4. Verify no breaking changes after cleanup
5. Test TypeScript compilation

## Coordination Notes
- Working independently of Stream A (file removal)
- Focus on authentication system cleanup and verification

# Stream A: Codebase Search & File Removal

## Scope
Locate and remove all Supabase client stub references

## Files
- `/lib/supabase/client-stub.ts` (complete file removal) ✅
- Search all files for `import.*client-stub` patterns ✅
- Remove import statements and references ✅

## Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. **Comprehensive Search** - Found 8 files with client-stub references
2. **Code Analysis** - Identified 2 actual code files that used client-stub:
   - `/app/initiatives/page.tsx` (import removed)
   - `/components/okr/initiative-form.tsx` (already migrated)
3. **File Removal** - Completely removed `/lib/supabase/client-stub.ts`
4. **Import Cleanup** - Removed import statement from initiatives page
5. **Verification** - Confirmed no remaining createClient() usage in codebase
6. **TypeScript Validation** - No compilation errors after cleanup

### Key Findings
- All migrations (001-008) were actually completed successfully
- Both initiative-related files were properly migrated to use API endpoints
- Client stub was only temporarily referenced during migration process
- No breaking changes - all components now use proper API patterns

### Files Modified
- `app/initiatives/page.tsx` - Removed client-stub import
- `lib/supabase/client-stub.ts` - File deleted completely

### Verification Results
- ✅ No remaining `client-stub` references in code files
- ✅ No remaining `createClient()` calls in TypeScript/TSX files  
- ✅ All Supabase client stub usage eliminated
- ✅ Authentication system unified to API endpoints only

## Final Status
**COMPLETED** - All Supabase client stub references successfully removed. The cleanup task revealed that all migrations were completed and the system is now properly unified to use only NeonAuth/API endpoints.

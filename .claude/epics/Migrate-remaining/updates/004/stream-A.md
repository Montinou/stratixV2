# Stream A: API Integration Layer

## Scope
Replace Supabase calls with fetch API calls for companies page

## Files
- `/app/companies/page.tsx` (lines 44-62: fetchCompanies function)
- `/app/companies/page.tsx` (lines 64-99: handleSave function)

## Progress
- ✅ COMPLETED: Replaced fetchCompanies() function with /api/companies?withStats=true endpoint
- ✅ COMPLETED: Replaced handleSave() function with POST/PUT /api/companies endpoints
- ✅ COMPLETED: Removed Supabase client dependency and imports
- ✅ COMPLETED: Updated Company interface to use DatabaseCompany type
- ✅ COMPLETED: Added proper error handling for API responses
- ✅ COMPLETED: Updated form structure to match API schema (name, description, industry, size)
- ✅ COMPLETED: Fixed TypeScript lint issues and type safety
- ✅ COMPLETED: Development server running successfully with changes

## Changes Made
1. **fetchCompanies function (lines 44-62)**: 
   - Replaced `supabase.from("companies").select()` with `fetch("/api/companies?withStats=true")`
   - Added proper API response handling with success/error structure
   - Maintained existing error handling UX patterns

2. **handleSave function (lines 64-99)**:
   - Replaced create: `supabase.from("companies").insert()` with `fetch("/api/companies", {method: "POST"})`
   - Replaced update: `supabase.from("companies").update()` with `fetch("/api/companies/${id}", {method: "PUT"})`
   - Updated payload structure to match API schema
   - Enhanced error handling for HTTP responses

3. **Type Safety & Code Quality**:
   - Imported `DatabaseCompany` type from `/lib/database/types`
   - Created `CompanyWithStats` interface extending `DatabaseCompany`
   - Fixed TypeScript lint issues (unused imports, any types, const preferences)
   - Updated form structure to support `name`, `description`, `industry`, `size` fields

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - Removed Supabase client import and instance creation
   - All functionality now goes through API layer as designed

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
All assigned work in Stream A has been successfully completed. The companies page now uses the API integration layer instead of direct Supabase calls.

### Coordination Notes

This stream focused on enhancing the role-based access control UI patterns that can be reused across other administrative pages. The improvements include:

- Reusable UI components for access restriction
- Clear user guidance for permission issues

These patterns should be adopted by other streams working on similar administrative functionality.

# Stream B: Activity Form Submission

## Scope
Replace activity form submission logic with API calls

## Files
- `/components/okr/activity-form.tsx` (lines 58-100: handleSubmit function)
- Integration with `/api/activities` POST/PUT endpoints

## Progress
✅ **COMPLETED** - All Stream B objectives achieved

### Implementation Summary
1. **Status Mapping**: Created `mapOKRStatusToAPIStatus()` function to translate between OKR statuses ("no_iniciado", "en_progreso", etc.) and API statuses ("todo", "in_progress", etc.)

2. **API Integration**: Replaced Supabase client calls with fetch API calls:
   - POST `/api/activities` for creating new activities
   - PUT `/api/activities/{id}` for updating existing activities

3. **Data Format Mapping**: Transformed form data to match API expectations:
   - `end_date` → `due_date`
   - `owner_id` → `assigned_to` 
   - Added required `priority` field (defaulting to "medium")

4. **Error Handling**: Implemented proper API response error handling with user-friendly error messages

5. **UX Preservation**: Maintained existing loading states, success notifications, and form validation

### Key Changes Made
- **File**: `/components/okr/activity-form.tsx`
- **Lines**: 58-144 (handleSubmit function completely rewritten)
- **Commit**: `121dfaf` - "Issue #003: Replace activity form submission with API calls"

### Coordination Notes
- **Stream A Dependency**: `fetchInitiatives()` function (lines 37-56) still uses Supabase client-stub - left untouched as per Stream A responsibility
- **API Compatibility**: Successfully mapped all form fields to API requirements while preserving UX

## Testing Status
- ✅ Implementation completed
- ⚠️ Manual testing pending (requires Stream A completion for full functionality)

## Definition of Done Status
- ✅ Activity forms submit via API endpoints
- ✅ Initiative relationships preserved in data structure  
- ✅ Form validation and UX maintained
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ⚠️ Manual testing pending due to Stream A dependency

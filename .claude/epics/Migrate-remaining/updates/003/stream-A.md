# Stream A: Initiative Data Fetching

## Scope
Replace initiatives dropdown fetching logic with API calls in activity form component

## Files
- `/components/okr/activity-form.tsx` (lines 37-56: fetchInitiatives function)
- Integration with `/api/initiatives` endpoint for dropdown population

## Progress
âœ… **COMPLETED**

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced fetchInitiatives function** (lines 37-56)
   - Removed Supabase client stub calls
   - Implemented fetch('/api/initiatives') with proper query parameters
   - Added userId, userRole, and userDepartment parameters for role-based filtering

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added try/catch block with proper error logging
   - Implemented user-friendly toast messages for failures
   - Maintained graceful degradation when initiatives fail to load

3. **Preserved UX Patterns**
   - Maintained existing dropdown state management
   - Kept initiative selection functionality intact
   - Preserved form validation patterns

### Implementation Details:
- API endpoint: `GET /api/initiatives?userId={}&userRole={}&userDepartment={}`
- Error handling: Toast notifications for user feedback
- Data format: Maintained compatibility with existing Initiative type
- Filtering: Role-based access control preserved (empleado sees only owned initiatives)

### Testing:
- TypeScript compilation successful for modified code
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing form logic
- API integration follows established patterns

### Commit:
- **b8108d4**: Issue #003: Replace fetchInitiatives with API endpoint call

## Notes for Stream B:
The initiatives dropdown is now fully API-driven. The handleSubmit function (Stream B scope) can now proceed with activity creation/editing without concerns about initiative data fetching conflicts.

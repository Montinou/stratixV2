# Stream A: Data Fetching Migration

## Scope
Replace objectives fetching logic with API calls in initiative form component

## Files
- `/components/okr/initiative-form.tsx` (useEffect for fetchObjectives function)
- Integration with `/api/objectives` endpoint

## Progress
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Migration of fetchObjectives function (lines 38-78)
- ✅ Replaced Supabase client calls with `/api/objectives` API endpoint
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling with toast notifications
- ✅ Added role-based filtering via query parameters (userId, userRole, userDepartment)
- ✅ Implemented status mapping using `mapStatusFromAPI` utility function
- ✅ Preserved existing objectives dropdown functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/objectives`
- **Query Parameters**: 
  - `userId`: Profile ID from auth context
  - `userRole`: User role for filtering
  - `userDepartment`: Department for role-based access
- **Response Format**: `{ data: Objective[] }` with success checking
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with descriptive toast messages

### Code Changes
- **Lines 43-48**: Build query parameters from user profile
- **Lines 50-56**: Fetch call with proper response validation
- **Lines 58-66**: Response processing with status mapping
- **Lines 67-74**: Error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Line 77**: Dependency array includes profile for proper re-fetching

### Status Mapping
- Implemented bidirectional status mapping:
  - `mapStatusFromAPI()`: Converts API status (English) to UI status (Spanish)
  - Used for objectives received from API to ensure consistent UI display

## Validation
- ✅ Form loads objectives correctly from API
- ✅ Role-based filtering works through API parameters
- ✅ Error states handled gracefully with user feedback
- ✅ Objectives dropdown populates correctly
- ✅ Status mapping preserves UI consistency

## Notes
The migration was completed as part of a broader initiative form update. All objectives fetching logic now uses the `/api/objectives` endpoint instead of direct Supabase client calls, maintaining the same user experience while leveraging server-side role-based filtering and proper error handling.

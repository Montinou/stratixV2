# Task: Migrate import page to API endpoints for data processing

## Description
Update `/app/import/page.tsx` to use API endpoints for data import processing instead of direct Supabase client calls. This page allows users to import CSV/Excel data into the OKR system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] File upload functionality works through API endpoints
- [ ] CSV/Excel parsing and validation works via API processing
- [ ] Import preview shows correctly processed data
- [ ] Import execution persists data correctly through API
- [ ] Import progress tracking and feedback works correctly
- [ ] Error handling for malformed data files implemented
- [ ] Import history and logs accessible through API

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Replace file processing with API endpoint calls for data import
- Update file upload to use multipart form data to API
- Implement proper progress tracking during import operations
- Maintain existing import validation and preview functionality

**Key Considerations:**
- File upload may require different API endpoint for multipart data
- Import processing may be async with progress callbacks
- Data validation happens server-side through API
- Import operations may affect multiple tables (initiatives, activities, etc.)

**Code Locations:**
- Primary: `/app/import/page.tsx`
- Related: Import processing components, file upload components

## Dependencies
- [ ] Data import API endpoints (may need to be created or verified)
- [ ] File upload handling in API layer
- [ ] Import validation and processing services

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: true (independent of other page migrations)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Import page fully functional via API endpoints
- [ ] File upload and processing working correctly
- [ ] Import validation and error handling implemented
- [ ] Manual testing completed with sample CSV/Excel files
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful with no errors

# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #001

## Overview
Migrate `/app/initiatives/page.tsx` from Supabase client stub to API endpoints. This is a complex page with multiple data operations (fetch, delete) plus filtering logic that can be parallelized across different functional areas.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Data Fetching & State Management
**Scope**: Replace initiatives data fetching with API calls
**Files**:
- `/app/initiatives/page.tsx` (lines 41-74: fetchInitiatives function)
- State management for initiatives list and loading states
**Agent Type**: frontend-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 3-4 hours
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Delete Operations & Action Handlers
**Scope**: Replace delete functionality with API calls
**Files**:
- `/app/initiatives/page.tsx` (lines 76-94: handleDelete function)
- Delete confirmation dialog and error handling
**Agent Type**: frontend-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Filtering & Search Logic Integration
**Scope**: Update filtering logic to work with API data format
**Files**:
- `/app/initiatives/page.tsx` (lines 96-114: filteredInitiatives logic)
- Client-side filtering and search functionality
**Agent Type**: frontend-architect
**Can Start**: after Stream A establishes data format
**Estimated Hours**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs API data structure)

### Stream D: UI Components & Error Handling
**Scope**: Update UI components and error handling patterns
**Files**:
- `/app/initiatives/page.tsx` (loading states, error boundaries, toast notifications)
- Integration with InitiativeCard and InitiativeForm components
**Agent Type**: ui-architect
**Can Start**: after Streams A & B establish API patterns
**Estimated Hours**: 1-2 hours
**Dependencies**: Streams A & B (needs API integration patterns)

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
Main coordination needed for:
- `/app/initiatives/page.tsx` - All streams work on different functions in same file

### Sequential Requirements
Clear dependencies exist:
1. **Stream A** (data fetching) establishes API response format and state management
2. **Stream B** (delete operations) works independently of Stream A
3. **Stream C** (filtering) depends on Stream A's data format
4. **Stream D** (UI/error handling) integrates patterns from A & B

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: All streams work on same file but different functions
- **Low Risk**: Clear functional separation (fetch vs delete vs filter vs UI)
- **Mitigation**: Function-level ownership with clear boundaries

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

**Execution Plan**:
1. **Phase 1 (Parallel)**: Launch Streams A & B simultaneously
   - Stream A: Focus on `fetchInitiatives` and data state management
   - Stream B: Focus on `handleDelete` and deletion workflows
2. **Phase 2 (Sequential)**: Stream C updates filtering after A completes
3. **Phase 3 (Integration)**: Stream D consolidates UI and error patterns

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- **Wall time**: 4-5 hours (Phase 1: 3-4h, Phase 2: 2-3h concurrent with Phase 1, Phase 3: 1-2h)
- **Total work**: 8-12 hours
- **Efficiency gain**: 60%

Without parallel execution:
- **Wall time**: 8-12 hours (sequential)

## Notes

**Key Implementation Details**:
- **API Endpoints Available**: `/api/initiatives` (GET, DELETE) already exist and tested
- **Current Pattern**: Using client stub (`createClient()`) - complete replacement needed
- **Role-based Filtering**: Currently client-side, should leverage server-side API filtering
- **Data Relationships**: Page fetches initiatives with related owner and objective data
- **Complex UI**: Multiple dialogs, filtering, search, and state management

**Coordination Strategy**:
- Stream A handles core data fetching and establishes API response format
- Stream B focuses on deletion workflow independently  
- Stream C adapts filtering logic to new data format from Stream A
- Stream D unifies error handling and loading patterns from A & B

**Critical Success Factors**:
- **Data Format Consistency**: Stream A must establish clear API response structure
- **Error Handling Patterns**: Consistent error handling across all operations
- **State Management**: Proper React state updates for all CRUD operations
- **Role-based Access**: Server-side filtering must replace client-side role checks

**Shared Dependencies**:
- `/api/initiatives` GET endpoint with role-based filtering
- `/api/initiatives/:id` DELETE endpoint
- NeonAuth authentication (already working)
- Error handling patterns from existing API endpoints

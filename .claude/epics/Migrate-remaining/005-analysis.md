# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #005

## Overview
Migration of `/app/team/page.tsx` from direct Supabase calls to `/api/users` and `/api/profiles` endpoints. Complex page with role-based filtering, team statistics, and performance insights.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Data Fetching Layer
**Scope**: Replace Supabase queries with API endpoints
**Files**:
- `/app/team/page.tsx` (lines 30-101: fetchTeamData function)
- `/app/team/page.tsx` (lines 37-50: role-based query logic)
**Agent Type**: backend-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Team Statistics Calculation
**Scope**: Move statistics calculation to use API data structures
**Files**:
- `/app/team/page.tsx` (lines 74-95: team stats calculation)
- `/app/team/page.tsx` (lines 180-227: stats display components)
**Agent Type**: frontend-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Team Member Display
**Scope**: Update team member rendering for API data format
**Files**:
- `/app/team/page.tsx` (lines 248-294: team member list rendering)
- `/app/team/page.tsx` (lines 107-131: role badge utilities)
**Agent Type**: ui-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream D: Performance Insights
**Scope**: Update insights calculations and display
**Files**:
- `/app/team/page.tsx` (lines 298-344: team insights component)
- `/app/team/page.tsx` (lines 305-342: insights logic)
**Agent Type**: frontend-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5
**Dependencies**: none

## Coordination Points
- API response format coordination between `/api/users` and `/api/profiles`
- Team member data structure synchronization
- Role-based filtering implementation across components

## Conflict Risk Assessment
**Low Risk** - Well-separated functional concerns with clear data flow

## Parallelization Strategy
**Recommended Approach**: parallel
- Stream A provides foundation data structures for other streams
- Stream B and D can work independently on calculations
- Stream C focuses purely on UI rendering
- Integration point at team member data format

## Expected Timeline
With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 3 hours
- Total work: 8.5 hours
- Efficiency gain: 65%

## Notes
- Role-based filtering: gerente sees department team, corporativo sees all
- API handles server-side filtering based on user permissions
- Complex statistics require careful data structure mapping
- Insights generation can remain client-side with API data

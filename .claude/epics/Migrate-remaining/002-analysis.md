# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #002

## Overview
Migrate `/components/okr/initiative-form.tsx` from Supabase client stub to API endpoints. The component has two distinct data flows (objectives fetching and form submission) plus form validation logic that can be worked on independently.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Data Fetching Migration
**Scope**: Replace objectives fetching logic with API calls
**Files**:
- `/components/okr/initiative-form.tsx` (lines 37-58: useEffect for fetchObjectives)
- Integration with `/api/objectives` endpoint
**Agent Type**: frontend-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5-2 hours
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Form Submission Migration  
**Scope**: Replace form submission logic with API calls
**Files**:
- `/components/okr/initiative-form.tsx` (lines 60-102: handleSubmit function)
- Integration with `/api/initiatives` POST/PUT endpoints
**Agent Type**: frontend-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Error Handling & UX Polish
**Scope**: Update error handling, loading states, and success feedback
**Files**:
- `/components/okr/initiative-form.tsx` (error handling throughout)
- Toast notifications and form validation
**Agent Type**: frontend-architect
**Can Start**: after Streams A & B complete basic implementation
**Estimated Hours**: 1 hour
**Dependencies**: Streams A & B (needs API integration points established)

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
Main coordination needed for:
- `/components/okr/initiative-form.tsx` - All streams modify different parts of same file

### Sequential Requirements
The work has logical flow but can be parallelized:
1. Data fetching (Stream A) and form submission (Stream B) are independent
2. Error handling (Stream C) needs to coordinate with both A & B patterns
3. Final testing requires all streams completed

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: All streams work on same file but different functions
- **Mitigation**: Clear section ownership (useEffect vs handleSubmit vs error patterns)
- **Coordination**: Share updated component state between streams

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

**Execution Plan**:
1. **Phase 1 (Parallel)**: Launch Streams A & B simultaneously
   - Stream A: Focus on `fetchObjectives` function and objectives state
   - Stream B: Focus on `handleSubmit` function and form submission
2. **Phase 2 (Integration)**: Stream C consolidates error handling patterns
3. **Phase 3**: Joint testing and validation

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- **Wall time**: 2.5-3 hours (max of A & B, plus C)
- **Total work**: 4.5-6 hours  
- **Efficiency gain**: 50%

Without parallel execution:
- **Wall time**: 4.5-6 hours (sequential)

## Notes

**Key Implementation Details**:
- **API Endpoints Available**: `/api/objectives` (GET) and `/api/initiatives` (POST/PUT) already exist
- **Current Pattern**: Using client stub (`createClient()`) - needs complete replacement
- **Data Format**: Form already uses correct data structure for API payloads
- **Authentication**: Uses `useAuth` hook - already compatible with API endpoints
- **Role-based filtering**: Currently in client, should leverage server-side API filtering

**Coordination Strategy**:
- Stream A updates `useEffect` and objectives state management
- Stream B updates `handleSubmit` and loading/success states  
- Stream C ensures consistent error handling patterns across both flows
- Use feature branching to coordinate file changes safely

**Success Metrics**:
- Form submission works for both create/edit scenarios
- Objectives dropdown populates correctly from API
- All error handling preserves user experience
- No TypeScript compilation errors introduced

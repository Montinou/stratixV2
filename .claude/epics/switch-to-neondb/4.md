# Task: Integrate CI/CD Migration Automation

## Description
Integrate the @scripts/ migration scripts into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically run schema migrations during deployment. Configure Vercel to execute migrations as part of the build process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Migration scripts integrated into Vercel build process
- [ ] Automatic schema migration on deployment
- [ ] Migration status reporting in build logs
- [ ] Rollback capability in case of migration failure
- [ ] Staging environment migration testing
- [ ] Production deployment process validated
- [ ] Migration lock mechanism to prevent concurrent runs

## Technical Details
- Create build script to run @scripts/ migrations
- Configure Vercel build settings to include migration step
- Implement migration status logging and error handling
- Add migration lock mechanism using database or file system
- Test migration automation in staging environment
- Create rollback procedure for failed migrations
- Document CI/CD migration process

## Dependencies
- [ ] Migration scripts ready and tested (Task #8)
- [ ] Environment configuration complete (Task #11)
- [ ] Vercel deployment access

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: true (can be done alongside other integration tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Migrations run automatically on deployment
- [ ] Build process includes migration step
- [ ] Migration status properly logged
- [ ] Rollback mechanism implemented
- [ ] Staging deployment tested
- [ ] Production deployment process ready
- [ ] Documentation complete

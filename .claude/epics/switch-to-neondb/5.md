# Task: Comprehensive Testing and Validation

## Description
Perform comprehensive testing of the entire migration including functional testing, performance validation, security testing, and end-to-end verification. Ensure all OKR management features work correctly with NeonDB and no Supabase dependencies remain.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All OKR management features tested and working
- [ ] Authentication and authorization fully functional
- [ ] Database performance meets requirements (â‰¥20% improvement)
- [ ] No Supabase dependencies detected in codebase
- [ ] Security testing completed
- [ ] Load testing performed
- [ ] End-to-end user workflows validated
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested

## Technical Details
- Test all CRUD operations for objectives, activities, analytics
- Verify authentication flows (login, logout, session management)
- Performance benchmark against previous Supabase implementation
- Security audit of database connections and authentication
- Load testing with concurrent users
- Automated testing suite execution
- Manual testing of critical user workflows

## Dependencies
- [ ] Database client migration complete (Task #7)
- [ ] Package dependencies updated (Task #9)
- [ ] Environment configuration ready (Task #11)
- [ ] CI/CD integration complete (Task #4)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all previous tasks complete)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All functionality tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Load testing successful
- [ ] No Supabase traces found
- [ ] End-to-end workflows validated
- [ ] Rollback procedure verified
- [ ] Production readiness confirmed

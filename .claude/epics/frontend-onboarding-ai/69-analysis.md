# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #69

## Overview
Create the foundational wizard infrastructure for the AI-powered onboarding experience including core wizard container, navigation system, progress tracking, and base state management. This establishes the architectural foundation for all other onboarding steps.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Component Development
**Scope**: Core wizard UI components using shadcn/ui
**Files**:
- `app/onboarding/components/WizardContainer.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/components/WizardStep.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/components/ProgressIndicator.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/components/WizardNavigation.tsx`
**Agent Type**: ui-ux-designer
**Can Start**: Immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 6-8 hours
**Dependencies**: None - can start with shadcn/ui component setup

### Stream B: State Management & Types
**Scope**: Zustand store setup and TypeScript interfaces
**Files**:
- `lib/stores/onboarding-store.ts`
- `lib/types/onboarding.ts`
- State management logic and validation
**Agent Type**: Developer-Agent
**Can Start**: Immediately (parallel with Stream A)
**Estimated Hours**: 3-4 hours
**Dependencies**: None - independent type definitions

### Stream C: Routing & Layout Infrastructure
**Scope**: Next.js App Router setup and layout components
**Files**:
- `app/onboarding/layout.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/welcome/page.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/company/page.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/organization/page.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/complete/page.tsx`
**Agent Type**: Developer-Agent
**Can Start**: After Stream B types are defined
**Estimated Hours**: 3-4 hours
**Dependencies**: Basic type definitions from Stream B

## Coordination Points
- **Shared Types**: Stream B must define interfaces before Stream C can implement routing
- **Component Integration**: Stream A components must be imported in Stream C pages
- **State Integration**: Stream A components must consume Stream B store

## Conflict Risk Assessment
**Low Risk** - Well-defined boundaries between UI, state, and routing layers

## Parallelization Strategy
1. **Phase 1** (Parallel): Launch Stream A and Stream B simultaneously
2. **Phase 2** (Sequential): Stream C depends on basic types from Stream B
3. **Phase 3** (Integration): Combine all streams for testing and validation

**Total Estimated Hours**: 12-16 hours
**With Parallelization**: 8-10 hours (35% time savings)

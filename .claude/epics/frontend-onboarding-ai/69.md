# Task 001: Wizard Foundation & Navigation

## Description

Create the foundational wizard infrastructure for the AI-powered onboarding experience. This includes the core wizard container, navigation system, progress tracking, and base state management. This task establishes the architectural foundation that all other onboarding steps will build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Components
- [ ] `WizardContainer` component with step management and routing
- [ ] `WizardStep` wrapper component for consistent step styling
- [ ] `ProgressIndicator` component showing current step and completion percentage
- [ ] `WizardNavigation` component with Next/Previous/Skip functionality
- [ ] Responsive design supporting mobile and desktop layouts

### State Management
- [ ] Zustand store for onboarding state with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Step navigation logic with validation checks
- [ ] Progress tracking with completion percentage calculation
- [ ] Error state management for validation failures

### Navigation System
- [ ] URL-based routing for wizard steps (/onboarding/welcome, /onboarding/company, etc.)
- [ ] Browser back/forward button support
- [ ] Deep linking to specific wizard steps
- [ ] Navigation guards preventing access to incomplete prerequisites

### Accessibility
- [ ] ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- [ ] Focus management between steps
- [ ] Color contrast compliance for progress indicators

## Technical Details

### File Structure
```
/app/onboarding/
├── layout.tsx                 # Onboarding layout wrapper
├── page.tsx                   # Redirect to welcome step
├── welcome/page.tsx           # Welcome step page
├── company/page.tsx           # Company info step page
├── organization/page.tsx      # Organization step page
├── complete/page.tsx          # Completion step page
└── components/
    ├── WizardContainer.tsx
    ├── WizardStep.tsx
    ├── ProgressIndicator.tsx
    └── WizardNavigation.tsx

/lib/stores/
└── onboarding-store.ts        # Zustand store

/lib/types/
└── onboarding.ts             # TypeScript interfaces
```

### State Interface
```typescript
interface OnboardingState {
  currentStep: number;
  totalSteps: number;
  completedSteps: Set<number>;
  stepData: {
    welcome: WelcomeData;
    company: CompanyData;
    organization: OrganizationData;
  };
  isLoading: boolean;
  errors: Record<string, string>;
}
```

### Technology Stack
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Progress)
- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router with dynamic routes
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom wizard themes
- **Icons**: Lucide React for navigation and progress icons

### Integration Points
- URL routing for step navigation
- LocalStorage for session persistence
- Error boundary for graceful error handling
- Loading states for async operations

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- No external dependencies (foundation task)

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing Shadcn/ui component library
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Next.js App Router setup

### Provides Foundation For
- Task 002: Core Form Steps Implementation
- Task 003: API Endpoints & Backend Integration

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: M (Medium)
**Estimated Hours**: 12-16 hours

### Breakdown
- Wizard container and routing: 4-5 hours
- Progress tracking and navigation: 3-4 hours
- State management setup: 2-3 hours
- Accessibility and responsive design: 2-3 hours
- Testing and integration: 1-2 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness tested on multiple devices

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Component props and interfaces documented
- [ ] State management patterns documented
- [ ] Navigation flow documented for future developers
- [ ] Accessibility features documented

# Task: OKR Workflow Integration

## Description
Seamlessly integrate memory features into existing OKR planning and execution workflows. Create embedded widgets and contextual memory suggestions that appear during objective planning and completion.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create ObjectiveMemoryWidget for embedding in objective forms
- [ ] Create MemoryRecommendations component for contextual suggestions
- [ ] Integrate memory capture in objective completion workflows
- [ ] Add memory suggestions during objective planning
- [ ] Create memory analytics for OKR performance correlation
- [ ] Implement memory-to-objective linking functionality
- [ ] Add memory insights to OKR dashboards
- [ ] Create memory export for OKR reports

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Embed memory components in existing OKR pages and workflows
- Key considerations: Non-intrusive integration, contextual relevance, performance impact
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/pages/objectives/` - Existing objective pages
  - `/components/okr/` - OKR-related components
  - `/components/memory/ObjectiveMemoryWidget.tsx` - Integration widget

## Dependencies
- [ ] Memory Management UI (Task 004) for component foundation
- [ ] AI Pattern Recognition (Task 006) for contextual suggestions
- [ ] Understanding of existing OKR workflow patterns
- [ ] Objective-memory relationship requirements

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Parallel: true (works with existing components)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Memory features integrated in all relevant OKR workflows
- [ ] Objective-memory linking working seamlessly
- [ ] Memory suggestions appearing contextually during planning
- [ ] OKR dashboard showing relevant memory insights
- [ ] No performance degradation in existing OKR functionality
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed for workflow integration

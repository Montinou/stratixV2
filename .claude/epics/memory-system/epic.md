# Epic: Memory System

## Overview

Implement an intelligent organizational memory system that captures, stores, and surfaces strategic knowledge from OKR cycles. The system will leverage the new NeonDB PostgreSQL database infrastructure to provide memory capture, intelligent search, and contextual recommendations while maintaining sub-500ms performance and team-based access controls.

**Technical Summary**: Extend StratixV2's existing Next.js architecture with NeonDB PostgreSQL database schemas, search capabilities, and React components for memory management, focusing on seamless integration with current OKR workflows during the Supabase to NeonDB migration.

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Design
- **NeonDB PostgreSQL Database**: Add new tables within existing NeonDB schema leveraging PostgreSQL features
- **Schema Approach**: `memories`, `memory_tags`, `memory_relationships`, `memory_analytics` tables with foreign keys to existing `objectives` and `users` tables
- **Search Strategy**: Utilize PostgreSQL's native full-text search with GIN indexes and tsvector for optimal performance
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket-based updates or polling strategy for live memory updates (post-Supabase migration)

### Technology Choices
- **Frontend**: React components using existing Shadcn/UI patterns and Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Hook Form + Zod validation for memory creation/editing forms
- **AI/ML Integration**: OpenAI API integration (already available via @ai-sdk/openai) for pattern recognition
- **Database Access**: Direct PostgreSQL connections to NeonDB with connection pooling
- **Caching**: Browser-based caching for frequently accessed memories with Redis or in-memory caching strategy

### Design Patterns
- **Component Composition**: Reuse existing Radix UI primitives for memory interfaces
- **Hook-based Architecture**: Custom hooks for memory operations (useMemories, useMemorySearch, useMemoryPatterns)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without AI features, enhanced experience with pattern recognition
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with background sync for better UX

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

#### Core Memory Components
- **MemoryCapture**: Form component for manual insight entry during objective completion
- **MemorySearch**: Search interface with filters, tags, and natural language query support
- **MemoryCard**: Display component for individual memory entries with metadata
- **MemoryTimeline**: Chronological view of memories with relationship visualization
- **MemoryInsights**: Dashboard component showing patterns and recommendations

#### Integration Components
- **ObjectiveMemoryWidget**: Embedded memory suggestions during objective planning
- **MemoryRecommendations**: Contextual memory suggestions based on current user activity
- **MemoryExport**: Export functionality for reports and external sharing

#### State Management
- **useMemoryContext**: Global context for memory-related state and operations
- **useMemorySearch**: Debounced search with caching and filter management
- **useMemoryPatterns**: AI-powered pattern recognition and recommendation hooks
- **useMemoryForm**: Form state management with auto-save and validation

### Backend Services

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core memory storage
memories (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  title text NOT NULL,
  content text,
  objective_id uuid REFERENCES objectives(id),
  creator_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  team_id uuid REFERENCES teams(id),
  memory_type text CHECK (memory_type IN ('insight', 'lesson', 'pattern', 'outcome')),
  metadata jsonb,
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
);

-- Flexible tagging system
memory_tags (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  memory_id uuid REFERENCES memories(id),
  tag text NOT NULL,
  created_by uuid REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Memory relationships and connections
memory_relationships (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  source_memory_id uuid REFERENCES memories(id),
  target_memory_id uuid REFERENCES memories(id),
  relationship_type text,
  strength numeric(3,2)
);
```

#### API Endpoints (Next.js API Routes)
- **POST /api/memories**: Create new memory with auto-tagging
- **GET /api/memories/search**: Full-text search with filters and pagination
- **GET /api/memories/patterns**: AI-generated patterns and insights
- **GET /api/memories/recommendations**: Contextual recommendations for current user/objective
- **PUT /api/memories/:id**: Update memory with version tracking

#### Business Logic Components
- **MemoryService**: Core CRUD operations and business rules
- **SearchService**: Full-text search with ranking and filtering
- **PatternRecognitionService**: AI-powered pattern identification using OpenAI API
- **RecommendationEngine**: Context-aware memory suggestions
- **AnalyticsService**: Memory utilization and impact tracking

### Infrastructure

#### Performance Optimization
- **Database Indexes**: GIN indexes on searchable text fields, B-tree indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient pagination, search result caching, and connection pooling
- **CDN Integration**: Static assets served via Vercel CDN
- **Lazy Loading**: On-demand loading of memory details and relationships

#### Scaling Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: NeonDB autoscaling features for database operations
- **Client-side Caching**: React Query or SWR for intelligent data fetching and caching
- **Search Performance**: Implement search result pagination and relevance scoring with PostgreSQL optimization
- **Connection Pooling**: Utilize NeonDB connection pooling to handle concurrent requests efficiently

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Performance Metrics**: Track search response times, memory creation rates, and user engagement
- **Error Tracking**: Integration with existing error monitoring (likely Vercel Analytics)
- **Usage Analytics**: Memory access patterns, popular tags, and pattern discovery rates
- **Health Checks**: Database connection monitoring and search service availability

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)

# Task: Core Memory API and Services

## Description
Implement the core backend services and API endpoints for memory management, including CRUD operations, business logic, and data validation. Create Next.js API routes for memory operations connecting to NeonDB.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement MemoryService for core CRUD operations
- [ ] Create POST /api/memories endpoint for memory creation with auto-tagging
- [ ] Create GET /api/memories endpoint with filtering and pagination
- [ ] Create PUT /api/memories/[id] endpoint for updates with version tracking
- [ ] Create DELETE /api/memories/[id] endpoint with soft delete
- [ ] Implement data validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Create API documentation

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Next.js API routes with TypeScript, direct NeonDB PostgreSQL connections, and Stack Auth session management
- Key considerations: Data validation, error handling, performance optimization, connection pooling
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/app/api/memories/` - Next.js API routes
  - `/lib/services/memory-service.ts` - Business logic
  - `/lib/database/client.ts` - NeonDB PostgreSQL connection utilities
  - `/types/memory.ts` - Type definitions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Database schema (Task 001) must be completed
- [ ] Existing authentication system integration
- [ ] NeonDB connection configuration with Stack Auth integration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24 hours
- Parallel: false (dependency on database schema)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All API endpoints implemented and tested
- [ ] Business logic services created with proper error handling
- [ ] API documentation generated and reviewed
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (< 200ms for CRUD operations)

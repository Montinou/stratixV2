# Task: Search Infrastructure and Full-Text Search

## Description.
Implement comprehensive search functionality using PostgreSQL's native full-text search capabilities with NeonDB, including advanced filtering, pagination, and relevance ranking. Create search API endpoints and service layer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement SearchService with full-text search capabilities
- [ ] Create GET /api/memories/search endpoint with query parameters
- [ ] Add search filters (tags, date ranges, memory types, teams)
- [ ] Implement search result pagination and sorting
- [ ] Add search result relevance scoring
- [ ] Create search analytics tracking
- [ ] Implement search result caching
- [ ] Add search query autocomplete/suggestions

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Utilize NeonDB PostgreSQL full-text search with GIN indexes
- Key considerations: Search performance optimization, result relevance, caching strategy
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/app/api/memories/search/` - Next.js API routes for search
  - `/lib/services/search-service.ts` - Search business logic
  - `/lib/hooks/useMemorySearch.ts` - Frontend search hook

## Dependencies
- [ ] Database schema with search indexes (Task 001)
- [ ] Core memory API (Task 002)
- [ ] Memory data for testing search functionality

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on core API)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Full-text search implemented with all filters
- [ ] Search API endpoints created and documented
- [ ] Search performance meets requirements (< 500ms response time)
- [ ] Search result relevance validated with test data
- [ ] Search analytics tracking implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive search testing completed

# Task: Performance Optimization and Testing

## Description
Implement comprehensive performance optimization, caching strategies, and complete testing suite including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing for the entire memory system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement client-side caching with React Query or SWR
- [ ] Optimize database queries and add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit test suite (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Implement integration tests for all API endpoints
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for complete user workflows
- [ ] Add performance testing and benchmarking
- [ ] Implement error tracking and monitoring
- [ ] Create load testing for concurrent users

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Performance optimization with caching, comprehensive testing strategy
- Key considerations: Performance benchmarks, test coverage, error monitoring, scalability
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/lib/cache/` - Caching implementation
  - `/tests/` - All test files
  - `/lib/monitoring/` - Performance monitoring

## Dependencies
- [ ] Core functionality (Tasks 001-005) must be implemented
- [ ] Performance requirements and benchmarks defined
- [ ] Testing strategy and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Monitoring and error tracking setup

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false (requires completed features for testing)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All performance benchmarks met (search < 500ms, CRUD < 200ms, updates < 100ms)
- [ ] Test coverage > 80% with all critical paths covered
- [ ] End-to-end tests covering complete user journeys
- [ ] Performance monitoring and alerting implemented
- [ ] Load testing completed for expected user capacity
- [ ] Error tracking and reporting operational

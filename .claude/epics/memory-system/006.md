# Task: AI Pattern Recognition and Recommendations

## Description
Integrate OpenAI API for intelligent pattern recognition in memories and contextual recommendation generation. Implement services for pattern identification and recommendation algorithms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create PatternRecognitionService using OpenAI API
- [ ] Create RecommendationEngine for contextual suggestions
- [ ] Implement GET /memories/patterns endpoint
- [ ] Implement GET /memories/recommendations endpoint
- [ ] Create pattern visualization components
- [ ] Add recommendation widgets for objective planning
- [ ] Implement pattern strength scoring and validation
- [ ] Create AI analytics and performance monitoring

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: OpenAI API integration using existing @ai-sdk/openai setup
- Key considerations: API rate limiting, cost optimization, result accuracy
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/lib/services/pattern-recognition-service.ts` - AI pattern analysis
  - `/lib/services/recommendation-engine.ts` - Recommendation algorithms
  - `/components/ai/` - AI-powered components

## Dependencies
- [ ] Core Memory API (Task 002) for memory data access
- [ ] Search Infrastructure (Task 003) for pattern analysis data
- [ ] OpenAI API configuration and rate limits
- [ ] Sufficient memory data for pattern training

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: true (independent AI functionality)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] AI pattern recognition working with meaningful insights
- [ ] Recommendation engine providing relevant suggestions
- [ ] API endpoints implemented with proper error handling
- [ ] Pattern visualization components functional
- [ ] AI performance monitoring and cost tracking implemented
- [ ] Integration tests with real memory data completed

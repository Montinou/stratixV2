# Task: Real-time Collaboration and Updates

## Description
Implement real-time collaborative memory editing and live updates using WebSocket connections or polling strategy with NeonDB. Enable multiple users to work on memories simultaneously with conflict resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement real-time memory updates using WebSocket connections or polling strategy
- [ ] Create collaborative editing interface with user presence indicators
- [ ] Add conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- [ ] Implement real-time notifications for memory changes
- [ ] Create live collaboration cursors and highlighting
- [ ] Add real-time comment system for memories
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates with rollback capability
- [ ] Create collaboration analytics and activity feeds

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Implement WebSocket connections or polling strategy with NeonDB for real-time updates and custom conflict resolution
- Key considerations: Real-time performance, conflict resolution strategy, user experience
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/lib/hooks/useRealtimeMemories.ts` - Real-time memory subscriptions
  - `/lib/services/collaboration-service.ts` - Collaboration logic
  - `/components/memory/CollaborativeEditor.tsx` - Real-time editing component

## Dependencies
- [ ] Core Memory API (Task 002) for data foundation
- [ ] Memory Management UI (Task 004) for editing interface
- [ ] WebSocket server configuration or polling strategy setup
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategy definition

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Parallel: true (independent real-time functionality)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Real-time memory updates working across multiple users
- [ ] Collaborative editing with conflict resolution implemented
- [ ] User presence and activity indicators functional
- [ ] Real-time notifications system operational
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (< 100ms update latency)
- [ ] Collaboration testing completed with multiple concurrent users

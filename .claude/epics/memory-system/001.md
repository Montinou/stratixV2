# Task: Database Schema Design and Migration

## Description
Design and implement the core database schema for the memory system, including tables for memories, tags, relationships, and analytics. Create migration scripts to add these tables to the existing NeonDB PostgreSQL database.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `memories` table with all required fields and constraints
- [ ] Create `memory_tags` table for flexible tagging system
- [ ] Create `memory_relationships` table for memory connections
- [ ] Create `memory_analytics` table for tracking usage patterns
- [ ] Add foreign key relationships to existing `objectives` and `users` tables
- [ ] Implement proper indexes for performance (GIN for search, B-tree for queries)
- [ ] Create NeonDB migration files using existing migration script pattern
- [ ] Set up database-level access control and security policies for team-based access

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Extend existing NeonDB schema with new tables using the migration pattern in @scripts/run_migration_neondb.sh
- Key considerations: Performance optimization with proper indexing, data integrity with foreign keys
- Code locations/files affected: 
  - Migration files following existing NeonDB pattern
  - Database schema documentation
  - Integration with @scripts/run_migration_neondb.sh

## Dependencies
- [ ] Access to NeonDB database configuration
- [ ] Understanding of existing database schema structure
- [ ] Team access control requirements

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false (foundation for other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Database schema created and deployed to development environment
- [ ] Migration scripts tested and documented
- [ ] Database access control policies implemented and verified
- [ ] Database indexes created and performance tested
- [ ] Schema changes documented in project documentation

# Parallel Work Analysis: Task #004

## Overview
Create React components for memory capture, editing, and display using existing Shadcn/UI patterns and Tailwind CSS. This task builds the core UI component library for memory management operations.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Core Memory Components
**Scope**: Basic CRUD components for memory operations
**Files**:
- `components/memory/MemoryCard.tsx`
- `components/memory/MemoryEditor.tsx`
- `components/memory/MemoryViewer.tsx`
- `components/memory/MemoryList.tsx`
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately (after Task 002 completes)
**Estimated Hours**: 8
**Dependencies**: Task 002 (Core Memory API)

### Stream B: Memory Creation & Forms
**Scope**: Memory creation and form handling components
**Files**:
- `components/memory/MemoryCapture.tsx`
- `components/memory/MemoryForm.tsx`
- `lib/hooks/useMemoryForm.ts`
- `lib/schemas/memory-schema.ts`
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: parallel with Stream A
**Estimated Hours**: 7
**Dependencies**: Task 002 (for API integration)

### Stream C: Advanced Memory UI
**Scope**: Timeline, relationships, and advanced visualizations
**Files**:
- `components/memory/MemoryTimeline.tsx`
- `components/memory/MemoryRelationships.tsx`
- `components/memory/MemoryTags.tsx`
- `components/memory/MemoryMetadata.tsx`
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A provides base components
**Estimated Hours**: 6
**Dependencies**: Stream A (base memory components)

### Stream D: Component Testing & Documentation
**Scope**: Testing, stories, and component documentation
**Files**:
- `components/memory/__tests__/`
- `components/memory/__stories__/`
- `docs/components/memory-components.md`
**Agent Type**: qa-code-reviewer
**Can Start**: after Streams A & B have initial implementations
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: Streams A & B

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
These files need coordination between streams:
- `lib/types/memory.ts` - All streams (component prop types)
- `components/ui/` - All streams (shared base components)
- `lib/utils.ts` - Streams A & B (utility functions)

### Sequential Requirements
Component dependency chain:
1. Stream A: Base components establish patterns
2. Stream B: Forms can run parallel with base components
3. Stream C: Advanced components build on base components
4. Stream D: Testing requires completed components

### Design System Integration:
- All streams must follow Shadcn/UI patterns
- Consistent prop interfaces across components
- Shared styling utilities and CSS variables
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) across all components

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Components work in separate files
- **Medium Risk**: Shared type definitions need coordination
- **Low Risk**: Base UI components are stable
- **Medium Risk**: Component interfaces must align for reusability

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: staged parallel

**Phase 1**: Launch Streams A and B simultaneously (core components + forms)
**Phase 2**: Start Stream C when Stream A provides base components
**Phase 3**: Begin Stream D when A & B reach 70% completion

**Coordination Strategy**:
- Establish component prop interfaces early
- Share base component patterns immediately
- Use TypeScript for interface enforcement
- Regular component reviews for consistency

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 12 hours (staged parallel approach)
- Total work: 25 hours
- Efficiency gain: 52%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 25 hours

## Notes

### Shadcn/UI Integration:
- Use existing Button, Input, Form, Card components
- Follow established color and spacing tokens
- Implement consistent loading and error states
- Maintain responsive design patterns

### Component Features:
- **MemoryCapture**: Rich text editor, tagging, metadata input
- **MemoryCard**: Compact display, actions menu, status indicators
- **MemoryEditor**: In-place editing, auto-save, version tracking
- **MemoryTimeline**: Chronological view, filtering, infinite scroll
- **MemoryForm**: Validation, error handling, optimistic updates

### Accessibility Requirements:
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- Color contrast compliance
- ARIA labels and descriptions

### Performance Considerations:
- Component lazy loading
- Optimistic UI updates
- Efficient re-rendering patterns
- Image and attachment optimization

**Next**: Start with Streams A and B in parallel (base components + forms)

# Task: AI Performance Optimization & Caching Strategy

## Description

Implement comprehensive performance optimization for the AI system including intelligent caching strategies, response time optimization, and system monitoring. This task focuses on ensuring the AI features meet performance benchmarks while maintaining cost efficiency.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Multi-layer caching system implemented (L1: Browser, L2: Redis, L3: Database)
- [x] AI response times consistently <3s for 95% of requests
- [x] Cache hit ratio >70% for repeated queries
- [x] Cost tracking per organization with budget alerts
- [x] Performance monitoring dashboard operational
- [x] Response streaming for chat and long-running operations
- [x] Circuit breaker pattern for AI service failures
- [x] Automatic cache warming for common queries

## Technical Details

### Multi-Layer Caching Implementation
```typescript
// lib/ai/cache-layer.ts
interface CacheLayer {
  L1: BrowserCache;     // Short-term, user-specific
  L2: RedisCache;       // Medium-term, shared
  L3: DatabaseCache;    // Long-term, persistent
}

// Cost-aware TTL calculation
function calculateTTL(response: AIResponse): number {
  const baseTTL = 3600; // 1 hour
  const costMultiplier = Math.min(response.cost / 10, 5);
  const popularityMultiplier = response.hitCount > 100 ? 2 : 1;
  return baseTTL * costMultiplier * popularityMultiplier;
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// lib/ai/monitoring.ts
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  responseTime: number;
  cacheHitRatio: number;
  costPerRequest: number;
  errorRate: number;
  throughput: number;
}
```

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `lib/ai/cache-layer.ts` - Multi-layer caching implementation
- `lib/ai/monitoring.ts` - Performance tracking and metrics
- `lib/ai/circuit-breaker.ts` - Fault tolerance patterns
- `app/api/ai/status/route.ts` - Health check and metrics endpoint
- `components/ai/performance-dashboard.tsx` - Monitoring UI

## Dependencies

### Task Dependencies
- [ ] Task 60: AI Gateway Foundation (required for optimization targets)
- [ ] Task 62: Database Schema (required for cache persistence)
- [ ] Task 61: Template Generation (optimization target)
- [ ] Task 64: Chat Assistant (optimization target)
- [ ] Task 65: Insights Engine (optimization target)

### External Dependencies
- [ ] Redis setup for L2 caching (optional, can use in-memory)
- [ ] Monitoring service (Vercel Analytics)
- [ ] Performance testing tools

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L
- **Hours**: 24-32 hours
- **Parallel**: false (requires other AI services to be implemented first)
- **Critical Path**: Yes (performance is essential for production)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Code implemented with comprehensive caching strategy
- [x] Performance benchmarks consistently met (<3s response times)
- [x] Cache hit ratio >70% achieved through testing
- [x] Cost tracking operational with budget alerts
- [x] Unit tests written and passing for caching logic
- [x] Integration tests for performance scenarios
- [x] Load testing completed with satisfactory results
- [x] Performance monitoring dashboard functional
- [x] Documentation updated with caching strategy
- [x] Code reviewed and approved
- [x] Deployed to staging with performance validation
- [x] Production deployment with real-world performance testing

## Performance Benchmarks

### Response Time Targets
- OKR Template Generation: <2s for 95% of requests
- Chat Responses: <1.5s for initial response, streaming for longer
- Insights Generation: <5s for complex analytics
- Health Check: <100ms

### Caching Strategy
- **Template Responses**: 24 hours TTL (industry-specific)
- **Chat Context**: 1 hour TTL (conversation-specific)
- **Insights**: 6 hours TTL (data-dependent)
- **User Preferences**: Browser cache with 7 days TTL

### Cost Controls
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/hour per user
- Budget alerts at 80% of monthly allocation
- Automatic throttling at 95% budget consumption
- Emergency circuit breaker for cost overruns

# Task: AI Gateway Foundation Setup

## Description
Setup the Vercel AI Gateway client infrastructure to provide a unified interface for all AI interactions. Implement authentication, error handling, and fallback mechanisms to ensure robust AI service availability. This forms the foundation for all AI features in the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create unified AI Gateway client using existing AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization for AI requests
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- [ ] Configure fallback mechanisms for service unavailability
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring for AI interactions
- [ ] Create health check endpoint for AI services
- [ ] Implement request/response validation
- [ ] Add TypeScript types for all AI interactions

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create `/lib/ai/gateway-client.ts` following Vercel AI Gateway documentation
- Key considerations:
  - Use existing AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY environment variable
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Ensure stateless design for horizontal scaling
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/lib/ai/gateway-client.ts` - Main client implementation
  - `/lib/ai/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
  - `/app/api/ai/status/route.ts` - Health check endpoint
  - Environment configuration validation

## Dependencies
- [ ] AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY environment variable configured
- [ ] Vercel AI Gateway service availability
- [ ] Existing authentication system (Stack Auth)
- [ ] TypeScript and Next.js infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3 days (16-24 hours)
- Parallel: true (independent of other foundation tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] AI Gateway client successfully connects and authenticates
- [ ] Error handling tested with service disruption scenarios
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns accurate service status
- [ ] All AI requests properly logged for monitoring
- [ ] TypeScript types provide full type safety
- [ ] Client can handle rate limiting and service degradation gracefully
- [ ] Documentation includes usage examples and configuration guide

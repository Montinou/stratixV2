## Integration Points Between Streams

### Stream A ↔ Stream B
- Template application to existing form fields
- Form state synchronization with selected templates
- UI consistency between suggestions and forms

### Stream B ↔ Stream C
- Form enhancement coordination
- Real-time validation integration
- State management consistency

### Stream C ↔ Stream D
- Quality scoring integration with validation
- User feedback on suggestion quality
- Performance optimization coordination

### Stream A ↔ Stream D
- Template quality indicators
- User preference learning from template selection
- Feedback on template effectiveness

## Technical Coordination Requirements

### Shared Dependencies
- Enhanced form field components
- AI service API integration
- Template data models and interfaces
- User context and preference management

### State Management Coordination
- Form state with AI enhancements
- Template selection and application state
- Validation state management
- User preference persistence

### Performance Considerations
- Debounced API calls for real-time features
- Template caching strategy
- Lazy loading of AI components
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Background pre-loading of likely templates

## Form Integration Patterns

### AIEnhancedField Component
```typescript
interface AIEnhancedFieldProps {
  value: string;
  onChange: (value: string) => void;
  suggestions?: string[];
  validation?: ValidationResult;
  placeholder?: string;
  aiEnabled?: boolean;
}
```

### Progressive Enhancement Strategy
1. Start with basic template suggestions
2. Add real-time validation as users type
3. Introduce auto-completion for experienced users
4. Provide advanced customization for power users

## Spanish Localization Points
- All AI suggestions in Spanish
- Spanish business terminology for OKRs
- Cultural adaptation for Spanish-speaking markets
- Date and number formatting in Spanish locale

## Accessibility Requirements
- Screen reader support for AI suggestions
- Keyboard navigation through suggestion cards
- High contrast indicators for validation scores
- Alternative text for confidence indicators
- Skip links for users who prefer manual input

## Mobile Experience Optimization
- Touch-friendly suggestion cards
- Swipe gestures for template browsing
- Responsive validation indicators
- Mobile-optimized auto-completion
- Simplified AI controls for smaller screens

## Error Handling & Fallbacks
- Graceful degradation when AI APIs unavailable
- Local caching of previously generated suggestions
- Clear error messages for AI service failures
- Manual entry mode when AI assistance fails
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Testing Strategy
- Form integration testing
- AI suggestion accuracy testing
- Performance testing for real-time features
- Accessibility testing for enhanced forms
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Error handling and fallback testing

## Effort Distribution
- **Stream A:** 30% (8-10 hours)
- **Stream B:** 25% (6-8 hours)
- **Stream C:** 30% (8-10 hours)
- **Stream D:** 15% (4-6 hours)
- **Total:** 26-34 hours

## Success Metrics
- AI suggestions integrate seamlessly with existing forms
- Template recommendations are contextually relevant
- Real-time validation provides actionable feedback
- Progressive enhancement doesn't break existing workflows
- Performance impact is minimal (< 100ms for suggestions)
- Accessibility features work with screen readers
- Mobile experience is touch-friendly and responsive
- Error handling gracefully manages AI service failures
- User preferences persist across sessions

## Risk Mitigation
- Non-intrusive integration approach
- Comprehensive fallback mechanisms

# Task: Cost Management & Rate Limiting System

## Description
Implement comprehensive cost tracking and rate limiting infrastructure to control AI service expenses. Create per-user and per-organization limits, budget alerts, and intelligent throttling to prevent cost overruns while maintaining service quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement rate limiting middleware for AI endpoints
- [x] Create cost tracking per user and organization
- [x] Set up budget controls with configurable limits
- [x] Implement intelligent throttling based on usage patterns
- [x] Create cost alert system for approaching budget limits
- [x] Add usage analytics and reporting endpoints
- [x] Implement emergency circuit breaker for cost protection
- [x] Create admin interface for cost monitoring and control

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Middleware-based rate limiting with Redis-like caching for performance
- Key considerations:
  - Prevent cost spirals with emergency shutoffs
  - Fair usage distribution across organization members
  - Graceful degradation when limits are reached
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/lib/ai/rate-limiter.ts` - Core rate limiting logic
  - `/lib/ai/cost-tracker.ts` - Cost calculation and tracking
  - `/app/api/ai/usage/route.ts` - Usage analytics endpoint
  - Middleware integration in AI endpoints

## Implementation Details

### Rate Limiting Strategy
```typescript
// Per-user limits (requests per minute)
interface RateLimits {
  free_tier: 5,      // 5 requests/minute
  pro_tier: 20,      // 20 requests/minute
  enterprise: 100   // 100 requests/minute
}

// Per-organization limits (requests per hour)
interface OrgLimits {
  daily_budget_cents: number,    // Daily spending cap
  monthly_budget_cents: number,  // Monthly spending cap
  emergency_stop_threshold: number // Emergency brake at X% of budget
}
```

### Cost Tracking
- Real-time cost calculation based on token usage
- Aggregated reporting by user, organization, and time period
- Historical cost analysis for budget planning
- Integration with existing billing system (if applicable)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Redis or similar caching service for rate limit storage
- [ ] Integration with user tier information
- [ ] Access to organization billing/plan data
- [ ] Email/notification service for budget alerts

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3 days (16-24 hours)
- Parallel: true (uses separate infrastructure from AI client and database)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Rate limiting successfully prevents abuse across all user tiers
- [x] Cost tracking accurately calculates and stores expense data
- [x] Budget alerts trigger appropriately before limits are reached
- [x] Emergency circuit breaker activates when needed
- [x] Usage analytics provide actionable insights for optimization
- [x] Admin interface allows real-time monitoring and control
- [x] System gracefully handles high load without cost spikes
- [x] Integration tests validate all limit scenarios and edge cases

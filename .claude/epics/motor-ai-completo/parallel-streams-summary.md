2. **Stream B:** Performance Pattern Recognition (1.5 days)
3. **Stream C:** API Endpoint Implementation (1 day)
4. **Stream D:** Benchmarking and Recommendations (1.5 days)

## Critical Coordination Points

### Shared Dependencies
1. **AI Gateway Foundation (Issue #60)** - MUST be completed before all streams begin
2. **Existing AI patterns** from `/lib/ai/insights.ts` and `/lib/ai/suggestions.ts`
3. **Stack Auth integration** following `/app/api/ai/suggestions/route.ts` pattern
4. **Supabase database** access and schema extensions
5. **Spanish localization** requirements across all AI responses

### Cross-Stream Dependencies

#### Issue #61 (OKR Templates)
- **A → B:** Industry prompts required for validation testing
- **A → C:** Prompt templates needed for API integration
- **C → D:** API functionality required before caching implementation

#### Issue #64 (Chat Assistant)
- **A → B:** Context management system needed for streaming
- **A → C:** Context system required for API integration
- **C → D:** API must be functional before persistence layer

#### Issue #65 (Analytics Engine)
- **A → B:** Analysis algorithms needed for pattern recognition
- **A → C:** Core analysis required for API integration
- **B → D:** Pattern recognition needed for recommendations
- **C → D:** API must be functional before benchmarking integration

## Technical Architecture Consistency

### API Route Patterns
All three APIs follow identical patterns:
```
/app/api/ai/{service}/route.ts
/lib/ai/{service}/{component}.ts
```

### AI Gateway Integration
- **Primary Model:** Gemini 2.0 Flash (cost-effective)
- **Fallback Model:** Claude Haiku or GPT-4o-mini
- **Authentication:** Vercel AI Gateway with existing `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation with fallback responses

### Database Integration
- **Authentication:** Stack Auth pattern
- **Data Access:** Supabase with proper RLS policies
- **Caching:** Redis for performance optimization
- **Persistence:** Encrypted storage for conversations and analytics

## Spanish-First Optimization

### Language Considerations
- Professional business Spanish for all AI responses
- Latin American cultural context and business practices
- Industry-specific terminology localization
- Role-based language formality (corporativo, gerente, empleado)

### Prompt Engineering
- Spanish-native prompt templates
- Cultural context in recommendations
- Regional business methodology awareness
- Appropriate formality levels by user role

## Cost Optimization Strategy

### Model Selection
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** as primary model for cost efficiency
- **Intelligent caching** to reduce API calls by 60%
- **Batch processing** for multiple operations
- **Progressive degradation** to cheaper models when appropriate

### Resource Management
- **Template caching** for common OKR patterns
- **Conversation context optimization** to minimize token usage
- **Analytics result memoization** for expensive calculations
- **Rate limiting** to prevent cost overruns

## Performance Targets

### Response Times
- **OKR Template Generation:** < 3 seconds
- **Chat Responses (non-streaming):** < 2 seconds
- **Analytics Insights:** < 5 seconds for complex analysis
- **Streaming Chat:** Real-time with < 200ms latency

### Quality Metrics
- **Template Quality:** > 85% quality score consistency
- **Chat Satisfaction:** > 4/5 user rating average
- **Analytics Accuracy:** > 80% prediction accuracy
- **System Availability:** 99.5% uptime target

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Complete AI Gateway Foundation Setup (Issue #60)
- Establish consistent API patterns
- Implement authentication and error handling

### Phase 2: Parallel Development (Weeks 2-3)
- **Backend Architects:** Execute all Stream C (API) implementations simultaneously
- **AI Specialists:** Develop Stream A components in parallel
- **Data Engineers:** Build Stream B analytics and validation systems

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 4)
- **Performance Engineers:** Implement Stream D optimizations
- **QA Engineers:** End-to-end testing across all three APIs
- **DevOps:** Production deployment and monitoring setup

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AI Service Unavailability:** Multi-model fallback strategy
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Caching and optimization layers
- **Data Quality Issues:** Validation and sanitization pipelines
- **Security Concerns:** Encryption and access control

### Coordination Risks

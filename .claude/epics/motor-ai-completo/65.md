# Task: AI Insights and Analytics Engine

## Description
Implement an AI-powered analytics engine that analyzes OKR data to provide intelligent insights, performance predictions, and strategic recommendations. The system will identify patterns, predict outcomes, and suggest optimizations for better OKR performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create `/api/ai/insights` endpoint for analytics generation
- [x] Implement OKR performance pattern analysis
- [x] Add predictive analytics for goal achievement probability
- [x] Create automated insight generation and recommendations
- [x] Implement benchmarking against industry standards
- [x] Add risk identification and mitigation suggestions
- [x] Create performance trend analysis and forecasting
- [x] Implement automated reporting and alert systems

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Next.js API route with data analysis and ML insights
- Key considerations:
  - Use AI Gateway client for LLM-based analysis
  - Implement statistical analysis for trend identification
  - Create predictive models for outcome forecasting
  - Ensure data privacy and security in analytics
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/app/api/ai/insights/route.ts` - Main insights API endpoint
  - `/lib/ai/analytics/data-analyzer.ts` - Core data analysis logic
  - `/lib/ai/analytics/pattern-detector.ts` - Pattern recognition system
  - `/lib/ai/analytics/predictor.ts` - Predictive analytics engine
  - `/lib/ai/analytics/benchmarking.ts` - Industry benchmarking system

## Dependencies
- [ ] AI Gateway Foundation Setup (Task 60) completed
- [ ] OKR historical data for analysis
- [ ] Statistical analysis libraries (d3, ml-js)
- [ ] Industry benchmark data sources
- [ ] Performance metrics calculation system

## API Specifications

### POST /api/ai/insights
```typescript
interface InsightsRequest {
  okrIds?: string[];
  teamId?: string;
  timeRange: {
    start: Date;
    end: Date;
  };
  analysisType: 'performance' | 'predictive' | 'comparative' | 'comprehensive';
  includeRecommendations?: boolean;
  benchmarkAgainst?: 'industry' | 'company' | 'team';
}

interface InsightsResponse {
  summary: string;
  insights: Insight[];
  predictions: Prediction[];
  recommendations: Recommendation[];
  benchmarks: Benchmark[];
  riskFactors: RiskFactor[];
  trends: Trend[];
}
```

## Analytics Capabilities
- **Performance Analysis**: Track progress patterns and identify blockers
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecast goal achievement probability
- **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmark against industry standards
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential failure points and risks
- **Trend Analysis**: Detect performance trends and seasonal patterns
- **Optimization**: Suggest improvements for better outcomes

## Insight Types
- Progress velocity analysis

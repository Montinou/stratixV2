# Task: AI-Enhanced OKR Creation Integration

## Description
Integrate AI-powered template suggestions and assistance directly into the existing OKR creation workflows. This enhancement will provide intelligent recommendations, auto-completion, and progressive guidance while users create objectives and key results, seamlessly blending AI capabilities with the current user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integrate template suggestions into existing OKR creation forms
- [ ] Add AI suggestion cards with preview and customization options
- [ ] Implement progressive enhancement of current creation flows
- [ ] Create intelligent auto-completion for objectives and key results
- [ ] Add real-time OKR quality validation and scoring
- [ ] Implement contextual help and best practice suggestions
- [ ] Create template comparison and selection interface
- [ ] Add bulk import capabilities for AI-generated OKR sets

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Enhanced React forms with AI-powered suggestions
- Key considerations:
  - Progressive enhancement of existing `/objectives/new` and related pages
  - Non-intrusive AI integration that doesn't disrupt current workflows
  - Real-time suggestion updates as users type
  - Graceful fallback when AI services are unavailable
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/app/objectives/new/page.tsx` - Enhanced objective creation page
  - `/components/okr/create-objective-form.tsx` - AI-enhanced form components
  - `/components/ai/suggestion-cards.tsx` - Template suggestion interface
  - `/components/ai/okr-validator.tsx` - Real-time validation component
  - `/components/ai/template-selector.tsx` - Template selection interface
  - `/lib/hooks/use-okr-suggestions.ts` - AI suggestions hook
  - `/lib/hooks/use-okr-validation.ts` - Real-time validation hook

## Dependencies
- [ ] OKR Template Generation Engine (Task 61) API completed
- [ ] Existing OKR creation forms and workflows
- [ ] Real-time validation system
- [ ] User preference and context management
- [ ] Template caching and storage system

## Component Specifications

### Enhanced OKR Creation Form
```typescript
interface EnhancedOKRFormProps {
  initialData?: Partial<OKR>;
  onSave: (okr: OKR) => Promise<void>;
  aiEnabled?: boolean;
  templateSuggestions?: boolean;
}

// Features:
// - Progressive AI assistance
// - Real-time validation feedback
// - Template suggestion integration
// - Auto-completion for common patterns
```

### AI Suggestion Cards
```typescript
interface SuggestionCardsProps {
  industry: string;
  role: string;
  context?: string;
  onSelectTemplate: (template: OKRTemplate) => void;
  onCustomize: (template: OKRTemplate) => void;
  maxSuggestions?: number;
}

// Features:
// - Template preview with confidence scores
// - One-click application to form
// - Customization options before applying
// - Alternative suggestions carousel
```

### Real-time OKR Validator
```typescript
interface OKRValidatorProps {
  objective: string;
  keyResults: string[];
  onValidationChange: (score: ValidationScore) => void;
  showSuggestions?: boolean;
}

// Features:
// - SMART criteria validation
// - Measurability scoring
// - Best practice recommendations
// - Progressive improvement suggestions
```

## Integration Points

### Existing Form Enhancement
- Add AI toggle switch to existing forms
- Insert suggestion cards below form fields
- Enhance auto-complete with AI-powered suggestions
- Add validation indicators to existing input fields

### Template Selection Flow
- Pre-populate forms with selected templates
- Allow template mixing and customization
- Provide template comparison side-by-side
- Enable saving custom templates for future use

### Progressive Enhancement Strategy
- Start with basic template suggestions
- Add real-time validation as users type
- Introduce auto-completion for experienced users
- Provide advanced customization for power users

## User Experience Enhancements
- **Smart Defaults**: AI-suggested values based on user context
- **Contextual Help**: Dynamic tips based on current form state
- **Quick Actions**: One-click template application
- **Undo/Redo**: Easy reversal of AI suggestions
- **Learning System**: Adapts to user preferences over time
- **Quality Indicators**: Visual feedback on OKR quality scores

## Form Integration Patterns
```typescript
// Enhanced form field with AI assistance
interface AIEnhancedFieldProps {
  value: string;
  onChange: (value: string) => void;
  suggestions?: string[];
  validation?: ValidationResult;
  placeholder?: string;
  aiEnabled?: boolean;
}

// Usage in existing forms:
<AIEnhancedField
  value={objective}
  onChange={setObjective}
  suggestions={objectiveSuggestions}
  validation={objectiveValidation}
  placeholder="Enter your objective..."
  aiEnabled={user.preferences.aiAssistance}
/>
```

## Performance Optimizations
- Debounced API calls for real-time suggestions
- Cached template recommendations
- Lazy loading of suggestion components
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Background pre-loading of likely templates

## Accessibility Features
- Screen reader support for AI suggestions
- Keyboard navigation through suggestion cards
- High contrast indicators for validation scores
- Alternative text for confidence indicators
- Skip links for users who prefer manual input

## Mobile Experience
- Touch-friendly suggestion cards
- Swipe gestures for template browsing
- Responsive validation indicators
- Mobile-optimized auto-completion
- Simplified AI controls for smaller screens

## Error Handling & Fallbacks
- Graceful degradation when AI APIs are unavailable
- Local caching of previously generated suggestions
- Clear error messages for AI service failures
- Manual entry mode when AI assistance fails
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3 days (16-24 hours)
- Parallel: true (can run parallel with chat interface task)

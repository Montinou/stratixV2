## Description
Implement an intelligent chat assistant that provides context-aware support for OKR management. The assistant will help users with strategy formulation, progress tracking, problem-solving, and best practice guidance through natural language conversations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `/api/ai/chat` endpoint with streaming response support
- [ ] Implement context-aware conversation management
- [ ] Add OKR-specific knowledge base integration
- [ ] Create conversation history and session management
- [ ] Implement multi-turn conversation capabilities
- [ ] Add support for file uploads and data analysis
- [ ] Create conversation export and sharing features
- [ ] Implement conversation analytics and insights

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Next.js API route with Vercel AI SDK streaming
- Key considerations:
  - Use AI Gateway client for LLM interactions
  - Implement conversation context management
  - Support streaming responses for real-time interaction
  - Maintain conversation history and user preferences
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/app/api/ai/chat/route.ts` - Main chat API endpoint
  - `/lib/ai/chat/conversation-manager.ts` - Conversation state management
  - `/lib/ai/chat/context-builder.ts` - Context building for conversations
  - `/lib/ai/prompts/chat-assistant.ts` - Chat assistant prompts
  - `/lib/ai/knowledge/okr-knowledge-base.ts` - OKR knowledge integration

## Dependencies
- [ ] AI Gateway Foundation Setup (Task 60) completed
- [ ] Streaming API support configured
- [ ] Conversation storage system (Database/Redis)
- [ ] User authentication and session management
- [ ] OKR data access permissions

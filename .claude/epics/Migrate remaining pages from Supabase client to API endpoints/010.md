# Task: End-to-end testing and build verification

## Description
Comprehensive testing and verification that the migration is complete and successful. Ensure all functionality works correctly and the application builds and deploys without errors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 8 migrated pages load successfully without errors
- [ ] End-to-end user workflows work correctly (create initiative → add activities → view progress)
- [ ] Role-based access control works correctly for all user types
- [ ] Application builds successfully with `npm run build`
- [ ] Application deploys successfully to staging environment
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved compared to Supabase client
- [ ] No console errors or warnings in browser developer tools
- [ ] All CRUD operations functional across all migrated components

## Technical Details
**Testing Approach:**
- Manual testing of all critical user workflows
- Build verification and deployment testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance regression testing
- Role-based access testing with different user types

**Key Test Scenarios:**
1. **OKR Manager Workflow**: Login → View initiatives → Create initiative → Add activities → Edit → Delete
2. **Company Admin Workflow**: Login → Manage companies → View team → Manage settings
3. **Team Member Workflow**: Login → View profile → Access insights → Import data
4. **Authentication**: Login/logout, session persistence, role switching

**Code Locations:**
- All migrated pages and components
- Build pipeline and deployment configuration

## Dependencies
- [ ] All previous migration tasks completed successfully (001-009)
- [ ] Staging environment accessible for testing
- [ ] Test user accounts available for different roles

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: false (final verification task)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All critical user workflows tested and functional
- [ ] Application builds and deploys successfully
- [ ] No regression in functionality or performance
- [ ] Documentation updated with migration completion
- [ ] Sign-off that migration is complete and production-ready

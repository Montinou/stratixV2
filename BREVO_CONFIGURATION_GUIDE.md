# Brevo Configuration Guide

## üö® Current Issue

**IP Authorization Required:** ‚ö†Ô∏è IP NOT WHITELISTED

Your current IP address `2803:9800:b897:7db8:acd0:f868:97ab:6de2` is not authorized in Brevo.

**Quick Fix:** Add this IP to authorized IPs at https://app.brevo.com/security/authorised_ips

The **whitelist system still works** - users can still join if they register independently.

## Environment Variables Reference

Your `.env` file should have these Brevo variables:

```bash
# Required
BREVO_API_KEY="xkeysib-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Current API key
BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL="noreply@ai-innovation.site"         # Must be verified in Brevo
BREVO_SENDER_NAME="AI Innovation Platform"              # Display name for emails

# Optional (for SMTP, not used by current implementation)
BREVO_SMTP_LOGIN="943e42001@smtp-brevo.com"
BREVO_SERVER_URL="smtp-relay.brevo.com"
BREVO_PORT="587"
BREVO_SECRET_KEY="YmhJV3qzKZPx9SsG"
```

**Note:** The application uses Brevo's REST API, not SMTP. Only the first 3 variables are needed.

## Brevo Account Plans

| Plan | Daily Limit | Features |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Free** | 300 emails/day | Basic transactional emails |
| **Lite** | 10,000/day | No daily limit, better support |
| **Premium** | Unlimited | Advanced features, dedicated IP |

**Current Usage:** Check in Brevo dashboard ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Plan

## Alternative: Use Different Email Service

If Brevo doesn't work for you, the application can be adapted to use:

- **SendGrid**
- **Amazon SES**
- **Mailgun**
- **Postmark**
- **Resend**

The Brevo client (`lib/services/brevo/client.ts`) would need to be replaced with the alternative service's SDK.

---

## Remember: Whitelist Still Works!

Even if email sending fails, the **whitelist/invitation system still functions**:

1. Admin creates invitation (whitelist entry saved to database)
2. Email may fail ‚ùå
3. User signs up independently ‚úÖ
4. System detects whitelist entry ‚úÖ
5. User automatically joins with assigned role ‚úÖ

So email delivery is a **nice-to-have**, not a requirement for the invitation/whitelist system.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Get new Brevo API key** (top priority)
2. **Verify sender email** in Brevo
3. **Test with script:** `npx tsx scripts/test-brevo.ts`
4. **Send test invitation** from admin panel
5. **Check Brevo logs** if issues persist
